welcome to the conceptual design meeting . i'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . so , who wants to start off ? technical designer again ?
welcome to the conceptual design meeting . i'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . so , who wants to start off ? technical designer again ? before we begin it , want to say i've i've put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not quite . it it still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that were layered over each other . so but , from now on won't use my pen anymore , so will be just ordinary keyboard . also in this one , like in the watches , but remote control can lie on table for day , and then you push button and so you don't have to walk with it all the all the time . solar cells are also bit weird for remote controls . also the case material , that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because wood or titanium would also be bit weird . titanium is probably trendy , . that's true , . little bit expensive .

throwing away my toothpick . what the , ja let's just start . i've made presentation but i'll open it on the smartboard , so we can all see it . let's see it . so it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . this is called the the the kick-off meeting . so i'm the project manager , so had to fill it in , and . and an agenda . we'll do the opening and then we'll meet each other , what we already do , so , that's not very much trouble . i'll i'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . then we'll look at the project plan from real reaction . we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then we'll close the meeting , and then we can individually do our things and then we'll get back here . so this the opening we'll we have to design new television remote control . you have heard that already , so . we want it to be original , so new design . trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just make it modern . and friendly , so size does matter . and has to be have the the the buttons on the place , that kin those things . other there happen to be three stages . functional , conceptual , and detailed design . so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , and then go into the next phase .

i'll i'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . then we'll look at the project plan from real reaction . we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then we'll close the meeting , and then we can individually do our things and then we'll get back here . so this the opening we'll we have to design new television remote control . you have heard that already , so . we want it to be original , so new design .
'll start just with another presentation , so then we can look at at the agenda for this meeting . i've put some new things in the in the map . this is it . the shortcut , so five . our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . and you also ha all three of you have prepared something about it . in we'll just have look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we thought we had dec decided . but then we'll look at the three presentations from you . you have prepared all three ? we'll look at the new project requirements we . you also have received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? and they can have two functions , because you have d_v_d_ and television . the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . it's one of our ideas . that wa it's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite but have to do it . the materials should be hard plastic with rubber from , and the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . it should be recognisable times . you already opened powerpoint . it's this one . but i'm not . this is it . i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . to start with these points . but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company . so we cannot just make someone no but that's the side they look look at is the front . it's not the the whole remote that changes , . but it , . so if if you make front with just tiger on it , then our recognition is gone . or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .

'll consider it . it's your your task to look into the costs of those nigh know . we'll think abo we'll think no , we'll look we'll look into that later . don't have any information on that . but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company . so we cannot just make someone no but that's the side they look look at is the front . it's not the the whole remote that changes , . but it , . so if if you make front with just tiger on it , then our recognition is gone . or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .

door is closed . because if we have as much time as the last meeting , we'll have to hurry up . 'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . i'll show you the notes . it's not as interesting as it should be because we just had the meeting , but i'll show them . we'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design .

'll show you the notes again . then that's your bit ? didn't see anything about it , so already thought you you were to do that . so the you're . i'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design . that's important too . and then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . we'll evaluate our our production and then we can close . the finance we'll do later , so firstly i'll show you the notes . don't t's very interesting . this is copy paste . from me , . you had some very strange layout . agree on this . no , don't . that's not the point and you might be you might be target customer . no but but for as far as see , three of us agree and only nils but you're the project manager , you can make the hard decisions . if you if you three agree then then that's it . so , we'll we we'll do it like this . no because we did not know anything about it . what do we what do we know ? all we want is is fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . yes , yes . so al alright , . one and half euros .
we have to do what ? some extra deciding . 'll show you the notes again .
we have to do what ? some extra deciding . 'll show you the notes again . you'll you two will present us your prototype . then that's your bit ? didn't see anything about it , so already thought you you were to do that . so the you're . i'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design . that's important too . for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . but , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . then we have the lower part of the of the device . which is part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . you can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under the under side of it , , the back side and the lower part of the front is titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour , the look . then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium titanium part .
we have to do what ? some extra deciding . 'll show you the notes again . you'll you two will present us your prototype . then that's your bit ? didn't see anything about it , so already thought you you were to do that . so the you're . i'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design . that's important too . know , know , know . but can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this . do we find it good-looking ? it let's start with the beginning , just one by one . we designed it to be good-looking , so . so but we have to be critic critical about it .
the first kick-off meeting . what shall we do ? first the opening , then the rest . what are we going to do . we have to make new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so we will get back on that . first we have to make functional design . after that we have to make conceptual design , and then after that detailed design . so we'll discuss that later . first we have look at . what have do we have to do . first you can save the documents . we have to do that every time we make something . you can print it . and we have to use the pen and the eraser . we all have to use this one . you have to make your own favourite animal . so i'll make an example . first don't touch that things . you can use the pen . you can change some things . format , line , and change it . and you can change the colour . so that's it . so so and after it you have to save it . now we can make new one . so now save ? blank , yes . let's try this . i'm not getting anything on my screen now . he did it before . no , no . so you can always go back . so that's it . so that was two . the we will sell the at twenty five euros .
the first kick-off meeting . what shall we do ? first the opening , then the rest . what are we going to do . we have to make new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so we will get back on that . what have do we have to do . first you can save the documents . we have to do that every time we make something . you can print it . and we have to use the pen and the eraser . we all have to use this one . you have to make your own favourite animal . so i'll make an example . first don't touch that things . you can use the pen . and then you can make something . you can change some things .

so welcome back . what do do we have to do ? want to say i'm the secretary , so make the minutes . you find them in your in the map in the from the group . there's the minutes from the first meeting . you'll find the next minutes also there . then wanna hear from you , what you've done . and after that have some new product requirements . so and after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . and then we're ready . we have forty minutes for this meeting . after that we'll have lunch . so first wanna ask the industrial designer to tell what he did . that's my task . so on your computer , or the what's the name ? i've where have put it ? my documents or not ? i've save it on my computer , my presentation . it was about the working of the remote control . what's the name of it ? it's the technical function or the functional requirements . the working design . it's about the working of the remote control . had an half an hour to study it and don't get it . ten minutes to tell it . it will be few minutes and first will tell you something about the findings , what discovered about the remote control . the working bout it of it . then i'll have some map , and it's the top of the remote control .
so welcome back . what do do we have to do ? want to say i'm the secretary , so make the minutes . you find them in your in the map in the from the group . there's the minutes from the first meeting . you'll find the next minutes also there . then wanna hear from you , what you've done . and after that have some new product requirements . so and after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . and then we're ready . we have forty minutes for this meeting . after that we'll have lunch . so first wanna ask the industrial designer to tell what he did . that's my task . so on your computer , or the what's the name ? i've where have put it ?

so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . this , you mean ? yes , this is it . this is it . it's it's it's yellow . and , this is rubber . and and and this too .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . this , you mean ? yes , this is it . this is it . it's it's it's yellow . and , this is rubber . and and and this too . the the sides . so if joystick and . what's the r_r_ . r_r_'s the the the the the company logo . so , we have so , what they say on the side is put fashion there . that's on the rub rubber part . that's about here . we if it's it if it's . so , i'm gonna look . do we do we change the do we change the the order ? or are we going to ev evaluate it first ? finance is it's no , first yes . we have to evaluate the product yet . the first on each item . what do you think ? it's , technologically using , it's not it doesn't contain many new features . so , it , will give it , , , four . the scroll-button is something also new . what not anoth , not lot of lot of remote controls have . technologically i'll give it an seven . si six six . so now you see it its statement . and you true or false .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . and on base of each criteria , we need to give rating . we can , it look like this . but we gonna do it here , they said . so , you hope found out how to do it with word document . we have the word document you so we open up that blank here . think , what this just an example . so , now we have product . but , is it cheap enough ? so if i'll have look . we have battery . cheapest there is . it's the most advanced .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . and and and this too . the the sides . and the rest is hard plastic . and we we had some we had new idea that that this can can be turned inside . and then it covers the these buttons until here . and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . this , you mean ? yes , this is it . this is it . it's it's it's yellow . and , this is rubber . and and and this too . the the sides . and on base of each criteria , we need to give rating . we can , it look like this . but we gonna do it here , they said . so , you hope found out how to do it with word document . we have the word document you so we open up that blank here . think , what this just an example .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two .
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . this , you mean ? yes , this is it . this is it .

so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . this , you mean ? and then it covers the these buttons until here . and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . so , you can still operate all the things . because you don't always use the menu . and then it can break . and the buttons ?
so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . this , you mean ? yes , this is it . this is it . it's it's it's yellow . and , this is rubber . and and and this too . the the sides . and the rest is hard plastic . and we we had some we had new idea that that this can can be turned inside . and then it covers the these buttons until here . and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .

so , now , last time . can you push the button ? so i'm still the secretary . now , ask you to presentate the prototype . one of your you two . yes , this is it . this is it . it's it's it's yellow . and , this is rubber . and and and this too . the the sides . and the rest is hard plastic . and we we had some we had new idea that that this can can be turned inside .

let me see . there's one of mine . roo , welcome back . hello , flores . the waiting is for sebastian . there he is . we have slight problem . is there any time for cup of coffee ? opened the c_d_ rom box . can get cup of coffee ? you can't , . so just cancel it . during my work have no time either . so so too . don't t's wireless here . it is , . or it is . the top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product , on the target group and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . we have forty minutes . so it's now . the new project requirements , first of all , we didn't speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . so we are not even going to try to implement it in our product . it's board decision . the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not feasible , it's not we we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with . the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , ruud , and as for roo . because the product should be interesting and and should be bought by people younger than forty . then for roo , as important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . so the colour colours and the slogan do have to be in the product . so that was the main important thing what remote control should do . then found two different remote controls , the multi-function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling already mentioned in the previous discussion . and the ease-of-use remote control with the less possibilities but feeling in in touching the buttons . my personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control , because the user-friendliness and it can be more trendy in in user design . but your new goal was for people than less than forty years old . so the multi-function can be implemented in in our design .

'cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . so so , like said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have now , and it's bad . prototype presentation , first you built the prototype . so you could could present that . but let's see what be handy to do . nee no , you just go ahead and present the we'll scrap it later because what ? it's more or less the same as we had . it's what we upon , but just little bit more specified .

wouldn't wanna be project manager . what we going to do . once again i'm gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . first we have prototype presentation by and . j_ and j_ . afterwards some eval eval evalu evaluation . evaluation crit criteria . and after that , an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let's start . would give the word to and for the prototype presentation . shall give short introduction and then . j_ and j_ . j_ and j_ . jane and jane . j_ and j_ , .
wouldn't wanna be project manager . what we going to do . once again i'm gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . first we have prototype presentation by and . j_ and j_ . afterwards some eval eval evalu evaluation . evaluation crit criteria . in combination with the finance received an an excel file which we have to fill in later on . and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and half euro . so , that's that's big so let's it we have we have must , we must have some time for that because it will be , quite lot of mathematics .
