it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in minute after take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . as we remember , opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? so we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work . working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . and it should not be very costly . so about the about what ?
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . the met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in way we have done rec not only recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also factor which will affect our sales and profit . so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls . the last one is the most important one , is it ? no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . have to remember these things . you'll be beginning your , your working design . u_i_d_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . how this can be achieved , and , , we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert . you will get specific instructions , , of what to do in the next half an hour . and i'll see you in half an hour , ?
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ? so if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or we could have everything generic but there are lot of remotes on the market now and this is most of the almost everybody has this . and and voice command did you . voice command we could specify anything . we could assign any button command to any button , if we have enough processing power , so . so that's that close your investigations ? not so far .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . so again , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we'll we'll make final final decision . and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether it is practical to use long lasting one . and our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . and it it'll be , , prominently displayed as part of the the advertising literature that it's , , for life , guaranteed for life . now the the the internal chip and this is where need kate's expert advice and given that this has to to go to market as quickly as possible do we go for custom designed chip ? or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? i'm i'm i'm not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of already on the market that we can modify . but that that's that's your area of expertise .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . do you also vote ? no , want to see something . we all have to agree on common . we can very easily . and need to as . need to if you we ha we have to put one if it's better or uh-uh .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . this is mango . the it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . you don't have orange , you have mango . strawberry's not as trendy , but so we'll come up with variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . 's very bright strawberry . it's been it's been little bit difficult to make that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , , it's not too big .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ?
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . so we've got forty minutes . and then do we get to make remote control ? 'cause we missed out .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . we introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ bit more , mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as . it's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . and then the buttons are actually poking through rather than on top . and the buttons will be much lighter blue , almost see-through . it's just very pale blue and light-up yellow . the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . and then at the bottom we have our logo . bright yellow design with the r_r_ which will actually look like our logo . like no , it's very fashionable . me too , very chic . thi would give it one . one , give it one . i'll give it two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . that's that's just like that's clay , it's prototype . what do you say ? i'd say two . alright , average is two . is it technologically innovative ? i'm taking over your job here . no , it's fine , you're you're project manager .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight . haven't as yet , no . but got got an email that said to make that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . so i'm guessing that notice on the bottom there it's got what's that ? a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour see in that is the red . would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the circular section , because that seems to be for video as . so we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there . then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . and then that's it .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this . and start if you want . is there an order ? so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ? teenagers and young professionals . that's for speech recognition . was thinking about that but speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the t_v_ is on it's making sound and the people on the t_v_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the t_v_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like silly , i'm not how you would implement it . that's only for speech recognition and screen . put the values in .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? raring to go ? press five to start it first . then the methodology adopted to find out all this was market survey . detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . and what we got was , we found that if you , what they what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . they are not so good looking . brian , this one also . turn my computer quickly if that's . very much brian . if you want me to help , . and then what do press , eight ? it's not coming .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does . we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and you're all thinking of , my , because we're only given forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . so we're going to make very fast track . and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . so the first thing have to do is close this so that get to where is it ? need to open mine .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ?
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . does that make sense ? have lot of the information there . it might not be very clear . unless you want to plug it back in to yours . we could do , .
so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
let me just confirm that . the case , what does it mean by single and double , do ? single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing . so we want double-curved ? is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ? we're gonna have to skip the rubber .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera . there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ?
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . just one thing . we have to ask . we have to ask the quest of that's design to the industrial designer . which is you . so try to find that for next meeting . so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so . so so will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . my name's poppy . i'm the industrial designer for this project . i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ?
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ?
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's he's been doing . it's so , let's go . if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really more technology and so , if if everybody in the house to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology . for the location . so let's now go to the you don't have more question ? no , it's . no more questions . puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that . and as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . so , can we highlight the specific features of our , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . you're , you have to so you say do we agree on that ? we have to . so , do you think . so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? no , no , you you can start . so start , .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . and am hemant , the industrial designer . for being here . so let's have look to the the agenda . so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ?
good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design . you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ?
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ? that would be you . me and william worked on prototype , and william is going to make presentation on that . though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and i'll i'll show you the presentation . so that is eight . that brings it down to two , and simple , . ease of use . easy to use ? based on what you've said there , would say one , true . would say two .
so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , . so it's the functional design stage is next , .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . ready to go ? so we've got our conceptual design meeting . i'm old as . hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . thirty's really young , ? so here's our agenda our agenda .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? and cherries are fun , summery .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ?
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts .
to make something flush with the case ? something bit more flush , , or have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also plastic i've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . sp kinda grippy ? feel like fruit . they feel like , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , little bit like . kinda like that .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? so we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work . working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . and it should not be very costly . so about the about what ?
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype . so this is our remote control . it's working prototype . you can use it now by switching all these buttons . so first , present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . that's , so that's that . we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa , and made some real good . you can add your buttons . it's in option . so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off . then you ha you'll have volume control . so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . one meaning that , ye yes it fulfils the the criterion , whatever it is . and seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil . and we're all going to list all the criterion . i'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . and then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our remote control . so , we can have look at the criteria ?
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ?
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . and that's all had to say for that . so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ? are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna , we should see yours first . i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . i've been looking at some trends in in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the the one that's the one talked about last time , that we'd asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we've also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . so , can we highlight the specific features of our , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . you're , you have to so you say do we agree on that ? we have to . so , do you think . so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and display clock so that people could you could see the time , , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and some holder for the for the item . that is it . then we i'm looking for three presentations . and whether the order matters much , don't don't , so whoever wants , . now my slide , . come on , close already . and that's number two , ?
they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ?
so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design . you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . do you have any preference of order ? would that work ? get yourself in position . so that's me again . so for the energy sources we can have basic battery , hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which wouldn't be wouldn't be , . don't think any of us remember the fifties . it wouldn't be very fancy .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ?
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . so we've got forty minutes . and then do we get to make remote control ? 'cause we missed out . so it's now that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . how how much do we have , forty minutes ? about four fifteen , . do you want yes . so , you said are are we starting with the the so will you start with like the the shape and things and and then will explain the the user interface things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and , but it's it's just an approximation . so going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . you think bananas are safe thing to use ? it's bit phallic . dual use , perfect . little bit over six . there are how many sixes ? no , , little bit under six . one , two , three . and one five . three sixes , , .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just little bit for ju just thought . you could simply have slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out bit more is on one side or the other . but as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the l_ the is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design . now got your note about keeping the cost down .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just little bit for ju just thought . you could simply have slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out bit more is on one side or the other .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are . it's pretty simple design .
so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as . so that's what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ? as for the case , discussed that know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel . and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , .
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ?
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ?
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? why don't get that ? screwed in quite tightly . what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gonna try incorporate it but we hadn't made definite decision on that ? should also point out that the the final objective of this meeting is to reach decision on the concepts of the product . so that's the end result hopefully . putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of . l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about . and the the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is . that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday . so so no need for an display ? so the power the battery in that sense , you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that but because the case is transparent so it gives it little bit of glow , doesn't make it freaky . they they emanate light through it . and then the other thing that we we're we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i'm thinking should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will wanna do . could we use like jog dial , like just round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? the question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? do you want to roll it like that ? do you want to roll it like that ? 'cause in mouse your hand's in position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? why don't we do it like mouse then ? if you're holding it in your hand you could do you think ? that's very unnatural motion to . can you imagine you have to scroll lot . it might work for volume , and some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels . if you have telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . anything you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? is everybody happy about what they're gonna be doing ? the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be . one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite big impact on the thing that's what was thinking the slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . incorporating logo is quite straight forward . there's lots of space for it but it's also marketing and function .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ? yes have it . so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . can put this on ? so we have to work out way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . this is to do this will not remove my microphone . we used some focus group surveys which went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . people have to then think about it and say got something there that want . that's really feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . third on the list , innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use . so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it . drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables . this is talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye-catching , really bold designs , and spongy feel . that's good idea . really like that idea . so what functionalities do you suggest for that ? for facing this problem ? in the present market saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . are we gonna hav hav an are we have we decided on whether we're gonna supplement it with anything , , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go we're . don't have any other questions on this . let's move over to , . the fact also that we are having rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . 'cause so if we wanna have lock of some sort it would have to be button . but that should be , speak with the button department , but that it should be easy to have button that just prevents prevents the other the other buttons from operating .
it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it . then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . so we've got forty minutes .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . don't really have favourite animal , but have one in mind , so i'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty the corner of white board . you have one in mind ? the spider has spider lives in web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions . unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of of web . and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . exp 'cause we we use we use , , everyday . and now having used remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or clearly better marked buttons , , things like that ? yes , feel the remote should be very compact . those which we get here nowadays it's very long . and and it should have multi-purpose .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . so we've got forty minutes . and it's spongy as . wasn't very keen on that , but . so so the user interface as as we discussed last time on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . so we have that channels here starting from one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . so it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , zero here . six seven eight nine . that's the second one . so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . so it has voice control . yes , so that's seven then . anyway it ha , it's the most sophisticated remote that ever seen . but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? so i'm thinking we should design remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . what do you think , ? this is , like cat , , soft . textile tactile , tactile remote control . although i'll just put there . you're dragging you have tail .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ?
it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting .
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ? there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , . we got bit ahead of ourselves , know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but . no but it's couple years off at least . it's pos possible new product . but that's that sums up the main features of our of the remote , if you have any questions or whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature . did we come in under budget ?
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it's gotta look like it's in the and . the the company it's it's , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . we put the fashion in electronics . we have to carry that mental . there you go .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there . then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . things falling everywhere . , put them in pockets . you don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time . so , my name's cat and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so . it's got no eyes . the eyes always ruin it . am the need my notebook , top banana . , am the marketing expert so like i'm gonna be doing the according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user requirements specification of the functional design , trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design so . and more about yourself , you're from ? i'm from leicester , second year . what else do you want to know ? like sports , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning and not with rabbits , no no .
so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation .
we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . can we just go over that again ? so bas at twel alright , .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use . her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped . and have an anar alarm-clock . and the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly timer to so that people can program their favourite program on from the remote . are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? that is it . then we i'm looking for three presentations . and the case . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something bright , colourful . bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . and also strong . trendy design and compact . trendy design , compact and strong .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time . i'm participant four believe . and now full screen . there we go . we have introduced ourselves , so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass to the second slide . and then full screen . that's where my discussion starts .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . that's the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? we could go for like not fruit shape but very curvy type shape . you could have the same texture and colour as fruit . so do are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ? probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . can have the laptop over here , or ? you have to come here . and you can see they're used hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , , while the user's watching t_v_ . the closest button that was used , the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , , all the other , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , , approx less than or equal to one times per hour . we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . and they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having very very high relevance . and the audio and picture settings had very that the users thought that the audio and picture settings were very weren't very important to them , and they used them very infrequently as . so we asked users what what frustrates them the most about current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also like in if you put it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and . you titanium it's more yes so . we can use something like the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to . like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and . but full assembly we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes . and this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so so it's like we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money , because , . seems not , it's either or push-button . no , it's not gonna be no touchable but still like source of information or source for menus . so let's try it , let's , , it's it's not gonna be touch pad , just display for giving you information . the would the display would only be display and not touch sensitive you mean . just for output , . you have any further questions or ?
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ? let me we've got forty minutes . so haven't made powerpoint presentation , , i'll use the whiteboard instead . you haven't made powerpoint , . , so i'll start off by i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are or highlighting or underlining them like that . let's hope the pen holds out . so i'll start again with brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of remote control and then we can probably discuss the various components . thes these are the kind different batteries that the company makes , ? does that mean like wind-up one ? so if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so they'll they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options . so the third one is the kinetic energy ones . you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v_ . and charging their remote , .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere . and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? that's the thing , i'm i'm not because on the the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . or , just the idea , but i'm not . so that's something we can discuss as . so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the t_v_ , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company . so is everybody with any of that , or do you want me to recap ? nope , we're all set .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls . the last one is the most important one , is it ? no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . but we've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . and how , what were making for the prototype . so i'm going to leave it at that and let you take over . the prototype discussion . do you need this ?
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? raring to go ?
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . three presentations , you can go in any order you choose . shall we go in the order that you just did it ? over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use remote and that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . it also mentioned something called r_s_i_ and was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r_s_i_ is , because . repetitive strain injury . repetitive strain injury . there we go . so if you cheers . it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it . and that it shouldn't be too small , that it it gets lost . now i'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . before do that , however , will go through some new project requirements that the the management have placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . this one this is the user centred , it has quite few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . so , what remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . and so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours . and so , for my personal preferences , this one is easier to use and has quite , fewer buttons . we want something that sends messages easily to the television and was wondering about this example that they have . it looks narrow at the top , and was thinking if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier . wide range sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . also definitely user-friendly interface and we've all mentioned adding locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . and that's it . it seems seems to me there are number of fundamental decisions to make before we your point about the the big energy source is very valid one . don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly independent ones . given , the number of things you buy these days , which , have lithium whatever battery in , that's , never needs replacing .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ?
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . and no teletext . so i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make presentation on , . so do unplug this bit here ? gotta plug you in . might have to hit function eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . that's page one of my presentation . for your first powerpoint it's lovely .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ? just trying to move mine now . courtney would you mind starting us off ? so if we want to go with that and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . really , the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and , you'd want like softer touch . address some of that issue , , with my presentation . but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , if we really want to go with that , because it is just trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just few months , because . people don't buy new remote every so often . that could just be spring thing now . which one is it ? interface concepts , no ? interface concepts new . either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there . mine will always read copy of something or other . copied mine before sent it over . so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have labelled . like on the side of it . if it's just up and down volume or channel . if it's just up and down . but is that for which ?
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea . i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it's gotta look like it's in the and . the the company it's it's , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . we put the fashion in electronics . we have to carry that mental . there you go .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . so you're participant two ?
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ? made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand . the the rhombus rhombus ? that's the rhombus , . this one is known as the potato , it's it's how can present it ? it's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your hand . i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . the met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in way we have done rec not only recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also factor which will affect our sales and profit . no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . so that indicates our technological advancement . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way . when we did fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that ? was just reading fruit and vegetables . hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . we have to , because you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming . we should make big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . that's very good . looks like looks like something out of jet . it looks threatening . it does look dangerous . it looks like . this one was really . it's it's got the programmability function that we talked about . so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . so multi-coloured buttons . you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , . or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . makes it easy to use .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ?
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it . then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this . bra that's that's like it . is it in who wants it ? three , three . the end product thingy . pedro can have it . like i'll help talk . so what we ended up with .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . findings , i've got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what's used in every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it's used for all all t_v_ remotes at the moment . and then we we're loo looking into battery options . there's actually no rechargeable option available , so we saw the the standard double and triple which we thought were bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that that might be bit silly to be to be honest , people won't it's it's like wind-up radio . wa can you explain that ?
so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design new remote control . so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . that mean it's very challenging project , and . so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there . there's the functional design of the the remote control . we're going the way we'll do that is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . and then the detailed design will come after that . we'll pull it all together . i'm bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert . hope saved it . so , , this is my name . know this name . we met before . so as , you you already know me , sammy benjo . am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . it is put five . the full page presentation , .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ? it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . people will wanna buy it . that was twice as important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . people have to then think about it and say got something there that want . that's really feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . and so for our design we want some programmable v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use like in any high-tech devices chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . so my personal design we need to find solution what what is the material of the cover we want to use . if it's plastic or you said that you had some ideas like fruit , veg or . ll we can give the the the case very normal very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . so like normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , , wooden case . just have just the veneer on it , .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert . know this name . we met before . so as , you you already know me , sammy benjo . am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . it is put five . the full page presentation , .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it . then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control . and then we're gonna close up the meeting . and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . first want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . that'd be lovely . didn't they didn't our rival companies manufacture remote that you would press the button on the t_v_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it . it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . , that's true . like go to the base . we could definitely include that if we wanted to .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in minute after take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . as we remember , opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . sarah , you presented marketing research report which rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly speech recognition . and then steph did second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . so we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah . is that alright with everybody else ? especially since kate asked to be last . sarah , i'm if misspelled your name , didn't know whether it was s_a_r_a_ or s_a_r_h_ . respond to either . you respond to whatever you get , ?
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you .
i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? and cherries are fun , summery .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , no problem . will take this time just to apologise . only , , received my emails later on . 'cause was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not not very good part of team-working thing . but there we go . i'm it's fine .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . my name's bob mor . and you are ? in the project i'm supposed to be the technic . so my name's bob morris . i'm the marketing expert for this project . my name is hamed getabdar , and i'm going to be interface designer in this project . so , , so today we are doing short meeting to present the project , so we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . we are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , . so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design new remote control . so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . that mean it's very challenging project , and . so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . can you recognise it as bird ? it's your turn to it's . so my favourite animal would be cat . that's its head . probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and playful . if should go with this .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . so , no problem . will take this time just to apologise . only , , received my emails later on . 'cause was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not not very good part of team-working thing . but there we go . i'm it's fine .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . three presentations , you can go in any order you choose . shall we go in the order that you just did it ? 's move on to the next presentation on effects . was that you ? have unscrewed it ? user interface , . here we go . and that's in the shared , if did it , if anyone wants to look at it . it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . my name's poppy . i'm the industrial designer for this project . i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . to meet you poppy . my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer . will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . hi , i'm genevieve . have to remember these things . you'll be beginning your , your working design . u_i_d_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . how this can be achieved , and , , we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert . you will get specific instructions , , of what to do in the next half an hour . and i'll see you in half an hour , ?
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? no , no , you you can start . so start , .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . try out whiteboard . so we will . so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . this is make the whiteboard works . so who wishes to go first . do you wish to go have first bash at whatever .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , . that is three . effectively one slide and we can discuss everything . so , this is our product or prototype . this is made by clay . the basic colour is yellow and red . the third feature is stable triangle base . this sta this triangle base is very stable , so so it's it's it's unlikely you cannot found it . so it's , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . you can can you can see the the shape of the buttons is mushroom , so , everything's mushroom . so we can call our remote control the mushroom . mush mushroom design , .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .
and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . anything you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? is everybody happy about what they're gonna be doing ? the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be . one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite big impact on the thing that's what was thinking the slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . incorporating logo is quite straight forward .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule .
there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so here's our agenda for today . we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow . or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting . we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . we're gonna get to know each other little bit better . tool training , we're going to , , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . we're gonna make project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . here is our project . we're gonna make new remote control that's original , trendy and also user-friendly . and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to we're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate t_v_ , blah blah blah . and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . same thing with conceptual design .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and go to that one . as you can see it was this earlier today . kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ? are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ?
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . and the case , it's more of single-curved case , would be that be the general and we've got rubber skin material throughout . push button interface with this other drop-down so we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? and special it's we've got wood materi rubbery type material that throughout , . and you have to mark special colour and special form as , don't you ? 'cause it it is very unconventional , like to think of it as unconventional . it's it's quite unique .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are . it's pretty simple design .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . and then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . and for the one also . one or two ? one to one . so the case , which one is it in the end ? we will go for single curve , no ?
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . is there anything else it can do ? that 'cause that's that's fine . just need to know so write it down . that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything . so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as ? we need an . and that's because of cost restraints is it ? what about the electronics here ? so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear . like so push button and integrated scroll wheel push . so reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . i'm not if that counts but you can see we're we're all very far beyond the could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . and special colour for the buttons , so four again . so why are we arriving at the number four ? functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is good estimate for , so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . do you think ? like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is single panel . have point three to get rid of somewhere . we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons . no can do . we could just go with . normal coloured buttons .
there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ?
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
imagine that's good question . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and symbols .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , . and so we figured it would be light weight plastic , just light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that rubbery material like they make ipod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . showing me age , what ipod covers are like . didn't know that but they're it's just rubbery and that way spongy like is something that people wanted and it just stretches over and that way probably helps protect it little bit too as and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ . but it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine . li that'll be the covers as , .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . my name's bob mor . and you are ? in the project ? in the project i'm supposed to be the technic . so my name's bob morris . i'm the marketing expert for this project .
put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's he's been doing . it's so , let's go . first with rama . so we're to mainly design mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting .
so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . who would like to go first ? i'll go first . alright , can st steal this from the back of your laptop ? so this is the technical functions design . go on ahead . to do the the design have i've had look online , i've had look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products . i've had look at the previous products to see what they offer and would like to ask you for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so , having look at the existing products , found out that it tends to come in two extremes , there's either very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you what you're doing . in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . there's an example i'll show you at the end , sh show you now . here the button there and there . this one's prog . that one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . not if you had look at the other control in that example . it's very simple one . it's got only the basic functions but it's the same size as the the hard to use one . it looked bit clunky . they're very big and not very much use for buttons . and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . there's there's nothing for slow motion button . my own preferences , prefer the the clunky one . it's very easy to use . but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which quite like having on the controls . so believe the the advanced functions should be hidden in drawer , like tha from the bottom of it . so , now i'd like to ask for your preferences . not of how long we've got , , the clunky one is the one on the . can chat away for for five minutes or so at at most . so in part could could give you some of my personal preferences but could also add some to this which is just about market research . but anyway , we might come to that later . shall we sh 'll stick to your area for now . which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . clunky in what sense , like heavier ? it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size . see , so it's more just basic . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that . just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have lost no .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? raring to go ? and what we got was , we found that if you , what they what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . they are not so good looking . so , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . and yes that's wi this will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales . and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also . if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with remote control , . so , figured , just put all together . you got caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and as for the user interface problem , , too many buttons . give it one button and and it's , for the the cowboy in all of us i'm not quite what the the function is there but it's you could have . like that design . is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? 'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . alright , so sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . that was more of gimmick . do you think ? it makes it fairly unnecessary then . so scratch that .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ? and it likes to sit like that . and you're francine , ? yes , i'm francina . would you like like just to see how it feels , so that you have little idea ? am supposed to wipe off that or . in no , no .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ?
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . so hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ? so you're four ? which is trend watch . mr marketing experts . investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you .
how much would that save us ? that will only save you one . that is one . the other thing could be that you could take away the panel and the advanced chip together , because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as , so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , which is technically doable thing so . that's fair enough , . so so what's our reviewed suggestion ?
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim . we are creating new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . first the functional design which will be first we'll do individual work , come into meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and meeting . so that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and collaborating . we're gonna get to know each other little bit . so , what we're gonna do is start off with let's start off with amina . alima , , alima . we're gonna do little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . it's quite carry your home around where you go , quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they're easy to draw . shall we just go around the table ? my name is iain and i'm the user interface designer for the project . and i'll try and draw my favourite animal . i'll should leave that one on there shouldn't before callously rub it off . no , you can erase the turtle , it's alright .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . it's kinda like peacock . it kinda was actually , 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and i'm like , this is the middle of scotland in like march . so that was pretty . and it landed by wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . wish i'd had my camera . so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here . so we'll have hundred percent profit then ? i'm bad at math . so now that , , that is underway , it is discussion time . so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , your personal experiences with remote controls , and , , areas you see that , , could be improved in your experience with them . does anyone have any initial thoughts ? find that in the dark it's often hard to button you're pushing . our next meeting will be in half an hour . so you have half an hour to , , think about what you want to present . or not present but bring to the meeting . i_d_ , whatever that stands for . have to remember these things . you'll be beginning your , your working design .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .
will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again .
so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . this is first concept of our controller . the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so so the the user the the user interface should be very very cute , very very attractive .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . so one one battery ? is that two or one ? it's kinetic reserve . actually it's flexible thing . now what is the whole day rating for that ? the excuse me ?
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ?
good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? it would that would mean you'd need television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ? bluetooth would , , enable you , , to connect you if you get call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs , you would get on your television you're being called by this person now . that would mean we'd have to make television as . things like that . no , that would be your telephone in with your television . the that wouldn't be the remote so much , .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ? the customers , . think that's that's important matter . that's the big question . so and then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll we'll have lunch . one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on minute . because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint our design based on what is more important . one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in remote control . speech recognition in . and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . do you have numbers on that ?
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway . it should work like this . so will try to get my presentation running . can't help you with that . it's no matter . then press al this . after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . see what our roles are in this project . so , we have been provided with some technical tools to to communicate and to , learn from each other's plans as say so we will also try to to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me whether you worked with them before . then we will come to the to the to the actual project plan . you all hope how it's about the new remote control we are going going to design . then we will discuss , , how it should be and wh what what our new product should look lite like . and then after some twenty five minutes hope we can end this meeting . this is about new remote control .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . so presumably that might be an idea to put into .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for . i'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation . corinne is our marketing expert . she's gonna figure out what what the consumer wants . ryan is our user interface designer . and manuel is the industrial designer . so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan , and you're gonna pick apart . how do get it . to go to the next one ? you click on that guy . this is my report , which is going to be based on survey that was sent . gosh , i've no idea . just press the arrow keys . that sends out the signal . the signal differs accordingly . depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . and that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . the way you normally normally do it is that you add little device such as lamp to the whole thing as , so that that it's working . you press something , you get response . the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . it it doesn't have to be there . this can be discussed as . the user interface . that's something we can also discuss . as we've heard speech recognition is the hype in the moment .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ? but how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , looking thing that we also need to focus on . could we have like an extra button on the top for on off ? so then we wouldn't have to have like dual function ? that's good , that's good . there we go . it's possible , , . the r_r_ will be in colour as , so . interface , we're doing push buttons . and how many buttons do we have ? we have six . we've got five . no , five . didn't get any pictures . it's single curved . it's single curved . t's not the . it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important . that is important .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren .
i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design . you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs . especially if we're selling into the u_s_ market becasue there's lot of spanish speakers there . something that sounds in english but sounds funny in spanish . what is that ? it doesn't it doesn't sound for me , but for spanish for for control . what does it mean ? what does it mean in spanish ? and was saying before about having different size buttons for different frequently used tasks , but also the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . so we we will have bit of simpler task in that we're only doing television remote control . because the same button is doing too many things . one option is to have little flip-open door that that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed flip-open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . three presentations , i've got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ? is it if postpone that til later , want to get access to little bit more information , is that ?
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . so people are used to that shape , . don't take care too much about the colour because we don't take . now we are supposed to give some oper offers now . so here would be the the the infrared led l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , the on-off button , in red . here would be the volume . on the on the left , , so easy to turn on and off . and so this is very cheap version so there are you can carry on matthew . also so you have browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , , if you have video you can forward , back . how can you change from v_c_r_ to t_v_ , by the way ? no no no , this is single this this is model with just the t_v_ one . no no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
like in circular in shape or choice of material . 'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape . it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either . no no no not . it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . so should we go with that ?
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . we should make big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . that's very good . so something like that we we should do . and people the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having plastic look , hard look . that's what we predicted anyway . so so that they could play with it while handi while handling it . so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . so multi-coloured buttons . you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , . or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . makes it easy to use .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , .
i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim .
and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ?
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . just one thing . you said twenty-five minutes , but have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon , so you could hurry up bit it's true . can give you the no ? but don't have to say anything . when i'm drawing the orangutan . it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . it's an abstract drawing . it's and original .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . and look at different types of material that might our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . so that's that . so possibly like , , just to butt in for second . possibly like cover like they have for mobile phones ? that's what was thinking . those like , , spongy ones .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features . so now we will have three presentations .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? you have powerpoint ? should be in my in their folder no ? who are you ? and we have technical problem . do we think in the in the wrong folder ? it is possible . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ? if you remember but that's . what we want here is remote control . so the question first of all what to control . so most people want to have remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and like that . so there's project called x_ house like that that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers . so there is one that is one thing . the other is the the finder feature by whistling or whatever . if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want . so it should be package in that case . so the user interface will consist of two parts .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . and then the buttons are actually poking through rather than on top . and the buttons will be much lighter blue , almost see-through . it's just very pale blue and light-up yellow . the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . and then at the bottom we have our logo .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint .
in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does . does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? we came up together , we're good . are we ready to start ? it's now quarter of four .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or . and they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . i'm not about that . so , in order to save our two euros was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . more like traditional remote control . it's already got shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved in and out . and by doing so no , hold on . doesn't save us quite as much . what's going on with this again . does it go back in , does it ? something we should get . what this is but it's really really annoying . have , yes . mine needs also this . at last mine is also the presentation .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . it's based on mango ? and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind . what was the where's the l_e_d_ ? it's in the middle of one of the little r_s . and then the other one is the power . and we just have simple design . we wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . so it's palm-held . notice you have number ten button . so you don't have to that was mistake , wasn't it ? no , that's zero . you just need the nought . and channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like it's the bigger . was there so on the top there is volume and channel up volume up . c_ and v_ . just so we can flick it's in the middle of one of the little r_s . where where's the power button ? so it's just like . i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's he's been doing . it's so , let's go . first with rama . so we're to mainly design mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . for energy there are two or three possibilities . so , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition chip in our remote control . so this can be simple programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . and we also want to look at our remote control , so . still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve euros or around that . so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in room or in house . so we discussed an excuse me .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . we want something new that's gonna stand out . lot more modern . modern so our remote should be . like user-friendly , like little , where you can use both hands , like little keyboard type thing . people , because people always tend to throw remote control about the place to one another if it was in ball , and the actual controls are inside . there are certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . course , that's true . so then you have bit more freedom to you you still have your blue fingers . let me get that . so what this is is set-up for us to use like the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as criteria of evaluation for the for the current design or the plan , and so we can review that . you killed monster . it's gonna end up being elementary because we're sort we're in we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? there it is . and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be way for us to go through and decide if we're review where we stand with it . so so to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , . so these these are the and we've been asked to to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just work on consensus system so we just come to an agreement . so the first one , stylish look and feel . rate that pretty highly . compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . me my only reservation with it was that we went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and if yellow's gonna really be hit . i'm seeing five then . would say five or six . i'm fine with that . let's go with five then . fi just actually the opposite . it's one to seven , ? one's high-ish isn't it ? one is high . so , two or three . let's go with two point five then . control high tech innovation . has the wee jog-dial but . we had to remove , so we've had to remove few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good . i'd go with three or four , three . say it's more medium , but going towards little bit higher than medium thing . about three , . style reflects fruit inspired colour , design . shouldn't have said colour , but just sorta . that's but the yellow , it could be lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ? the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the the the red button , they because for want of , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . so we'll go two . and design is simple to use , simple in features . it's really basic looking isn't it ? fairly basic , you think ? i'd give that nearly one . soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite bit of compromise for price . it's about five . that's really low . we have to use plastic so it's probably gonna be i'd probably increase the cost . it'll be cost prohibitive , . we've only got like what , ten cents left so . it would cost more than plastic . logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there ? and it's within budget , . it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ?
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this . and start if you want . is there an order ? we haven't decided on an order . no , any any order's fine . how do put this i'll just put the cable in . just you may need to but sometimes you have to do it it's like three set setting cycle , so press it couple times , hold down function and then press eight . is that it ? can you see ? so what happens it doesn't work ? you need to help me . and then press function . could you just plug it back into hers because she had . that's is that it ? here we are . the cable might be little loose .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . need to plug you in . so how sh do you want me to hold it ? it's inspired design . there we go , just screw on in . gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function eight . so , after that ? and what we got was , we found that if you , what they what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . they are not so good looking . so , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . and yes that's wi this will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales . and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . and if we make . two four to be fifty , be four million . you'd have to sell four million . experience with remote control . any of you use of remote control for television or d_v_d_ ? that that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for in home environment , for t_v_s and one that works would be good .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . so hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . mr marketing experts . investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you . what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ? is that alright ?
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get bigger market share and bigger audience . so method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . so in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device . and having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with better better inst implement than we had before .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . this is first concept of our controller . so if it is somewhere in the room if if it is in the table there you can always say channel one and the the remote control gives the order to the t_v_ to switch to channel one . you so you can build black box and put it on t_v_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . but so you need camera and microphone inside your remote control . but you would still have the buttons . or is it do you should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? so you got email ? we have only five minutes left . no , trend watching . the other one . so , just , so just to meet the user requirements would just do short anal analysis of the remote control market and to have better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . so again , it's similar to what i've said in the previous meeting .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . and then we're gonna close up the meeting . and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . first want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations . so you have this ? so we have three presentations , and we'll go in order of participant number here . so we can have look at the working design first from participant two . so so you all know me , i'm the industrial designer . but click it on off ? and we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just every remote'll need .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details .
nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get bigger market share and bigger audience . so method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . so in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device .
is this to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there . so you can power on and off , what else can you do ? three and half . you can skip straight to channel using these buttons . were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . jog-dial for volume . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . doesn't say so . how about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? that's good idea . does that mean that one button has special form or . there's just one button so handy .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ? made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate .
i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? that would make it very complex . we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there need for the remote control to to talk back ? if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back . you could put game on it . does anybody disagree with that ?
so , success on the whiteboard . there you go . you can harness the awesome power little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s and things we like about the city , we'll so moving on to not fun project finance . what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but , i'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty that's like forty bucks for remote . it would have to like do my laundry for me .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features . so now we will have three presentations .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . the originality is gonna take all of us . the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , sarah . and we'll get on with it . so we'll have functional design individual work with meeting and then conceptual design and then detailed design . everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , and while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ?
have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . i'm the marketing expert for this project . my name is hamed getabdar , and i'm going to be interface designer in this project . so , , so today we are doing short meeting to present the project , so we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . we are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , . so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design new remote control . so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . that mean it's very challenging project , and . so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . so , so what's what are we going to do during this all this project ?
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . so i'll be putting the minutes of this this meeting into the project documents folder . so just to just to confirm that we we're doing in the next the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our industrial designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . and you'll all get specific instructions as . so , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .
here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . this is our agenda , we will do some , get to know each other bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as understand . you can what i'm trying to make ? it's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . it's sitting down . see it as one thing it's very supportive . it's your best friend and your you can talk to dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . hope that clicks in , i'll just i'll hold it on , . dear , what happened there ? hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . again this is off the top of my head , was gonna do big cat too , . dear , it doesn't look what like what want it to be .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . so you're participant two ? no no no . no you're no , i'm participant one . three three , it's three . did you save your presentation ? in one , . no , no . this one doesn't want to be moved , . too for email then . the first will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote t_v_ control . will focus on user interface design . so move to the next slide . you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , suppose . but but this is . but if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . you you have some international standards , where , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . you mean for the pic pictograms or things like that ? here , escape , , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , that it should be the same . it should , .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design . you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype . here we have our prototype model . and you have some slides then ? we have also some slides .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one . so we'll just crack on , like to start with the industrial designer if it's possible . the con today is the concep today . i'll just have presentation saved it in the the folder . this meeting is the conceptual design phase and is about this . and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ? we've got trend watching , that's you . it's components design . the case le that's what wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . but later on we found out that it can be rubber as , or titanium or even wood . so we decide what it's gonna be . we need the infra-red transmitter .
this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . this is first concept of our controller . the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so so the the user the the user interface should be very very cute , very very attractive . such like this , there are several examples in the slides . i'm not the one in the middle is very attractive .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control . it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . as usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company . it is in three step as . first the functional design .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . like the r_r_ , that's gonna be etched in . hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but it's quite useful little gadget . all to iain for the design of that one . new ideas found ? what did we find for new ideas ? people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ? the customers , . think that's that's important matter . that's the big question . so and then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll we'll have lunch . why anna can you do you have presentations ?
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ?
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ? just trying to move mine now . courtney would you mind starting us off ?
didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ?
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . to meet you poppy . my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer . will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . hi , i'm genevieve . i'm the marketing expert .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow . or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting . we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . we're gonna get to know each other little bit better . tool training , we're going to , , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . we're gonna make project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . here is our project . we're gonna make new remote control that's original , trendy and also user-friendly . and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to we're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate t_v_ , blah blah blah . and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . same thing with conceptual design . we could , we could on here . alright , let's go forward then . now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . even if you are not good drawer like me . artistic skills , nil . draw like i'm in grade five .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ?
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just little bit for ju just thought . you could simply have slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out bit more is on one side or the other .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you . thirty's really young , ? so here's our agenda our agenda . i'm gonna open . i'm gonna talk for bit about what we're gonna do . i'm gonna take some notes . we're gonna all do presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . when say hopefully , we have to . so i'm gonna let you talk before we make decisions . and does anyone really want to go first ? my name is name . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . did this in bit of rush . prepare to die . so so here's look inside your really old-looking remote control . you've got printed printed circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate we've all broken remote control . we've all broke remote control ri .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . need to plug you in . so how sh do you want me to hold it ? it's inspired design . there we go , just screw on in . gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function eight . so , after that ? and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at time . actually , have to see the other , . yes , have to look at the market potential for this product , , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our net profit or our aims or not ? press five to start it first . then the methodology adopted to find out all this was market survey . detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . if the cable's gonna be long enough . kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as . brian , this one also . turn my computer quickly if that's . very much brian . if you want me to help , .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . i_d_ you want ? switch slide on your request . only have three slides , so . look at the just this . on some web pages to find some documentation and remote control is , as mentioned previously , you just have very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using wheel control . so was looking for that chip , which is very very standard , and looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , . on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . this is the power key , it's kinda like the biggest so how to turn on . that's the little menu key . this is the infra-red section so you it'll be sending rays and if you're pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . , good , good . we got microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can talk to it like that and it'll still understand . the logo is down down there and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . and so we figured it would be light weight plastic , just light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that rubbery material like they make ipod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . showing me age , what ipod covers are like . didn't know that but they're it's just rubbery and that way spongy like is something that people wanted and it just stretches over and that way probably helps protect it little bit too as and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ . but it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine . li that'll be the covers as , . we could just widen it out . could have one for your stereo , one for your d_v_ player . have to if we just lengthen it so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there . just or just make it little . but that that's but no the the the overall the overall concept is , no no , that's these . somewhere like that so it just . we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , , , like that , like that . kinda had kinda natural idea where it's like more of like kinda slightly like thinner , , kinda like that kinda like flower or plant for the more natural kinda , just click there . but but no but the the the the , , , it it's wouldn't wouldn't do that , . the final product would actually stand up , . but but the these were all minor minor minor details , the the basic concept is is bang on and the it certainly meets our criteria of being of looking different . good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the the the the boss can understand . now i've this is the company's costing for for various aspects of design and i've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us , wouldn't know for in if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not special colour , that's that's standard colour . so we're just simply on batteries , the the one the one decision i've had to make is that we're we will have to find regular standard chip to to do this with and i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around so , that don't serious problem . the the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made basic decision that that was fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to to make 'cause of the the the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we we should exceed the the sales targets . it's simply made of plastic so that's that's no problem and just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's there's some cost there .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ?
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or . unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros . so we have to rea , i've accidentally highlighted somehow . what's on the on the left ? there we go . why is it doing that ? there we go . so , in order to save our two euros was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . more like traditional remote control .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . so presumably that might be an idea to put into .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes .
both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . this is our agenda , we will do some , get to know each other bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as understand .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that . just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have lost no . and is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness . another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? is it is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , , they get ours and it's doesn't have that . it's as optional functions . if that'd be problem .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . so let this wonderful thing . so we can go to the slides .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? and your role in this is ? and , lastly we have ? and you're going to be the user interface , is it ? user interface defin designer , yes . this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype . here we have our prototype model . and you have some slides then ? we have also some slides . yes , and place some slides . so in which . so this is our remote control . it's working prototype . you can add your buttons . it's in option . so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off . then you ha you'll have volume control . so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? let's have your let's get have the presentation ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . so , everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here . so , , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , , the thumb button is the power button . your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . what's the big blue thing ? , these these ones on the side are curved , so the buttons are rubber . are they made out of any special material ? no they're not . they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple . they're rubber , aren't they ? so let's see if that comes within budget . i'd say it's about twoish ? it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , , , . so criteria three is is it easy to use ? it's one , . i'd say it's wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . would give it would give it two , 'cause it it it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but . two , so it's but if we make right-handed and left-handed then ? if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then would give it one , but otherwise otherwise two . give it give it two . criteria four is costs . it's come in under budget .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ?
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for . let's see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what . usually goes to it . actually need to see something else on my screen . hit eight again . you want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ? no want something else on mine . is that possible ?
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ?
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . so moving on . our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro . so i'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland , we're in some european country . and we will hope to sell this internationally . can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? selling price is twenty five euro . 'cause people just stick it on top of their t_v_ , but the point of having remote is not to have to walk over to the t_v_ , so . that's why it's always in the couch . in in the couch . it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and so we the project is now couches and remote controls . we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . but even just thing to attach it to the if you had thing , pretty object attached to the wall .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so i've been looking at the components design . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting . is there anything have forgotten anything ?
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . so moving on . our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro . so i'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland , we're in some european country . and we will hope to sell this internationally . can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? selling price is twenty five euro . 'cause people just stick it on top of their t_v_ , but the point of having remote is not to have to walk over to the t_v_ , so . that's why it's always in the couch . in in the couch . it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and so we the project is now couches and remote controls . we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . but even just thing to attach it to the if you had thing , pretty object attached to the wall .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in minute after take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . as we remember , opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . so we that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . alternatively it would be manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , but it still should meet those parameters . and that the function we was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . at that point we that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .
about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . so that's gonna be you catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . just connecting this . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing . i'm gonna draw it on the board then . it's in blue , and couldn't change it .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations . did you all receive that email ? so does anyone have any overall . what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be new product without something that people are very comfortable having now . so that's , from marketing perspective see see lack . and so we have to go , , in the other direction . what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than . so you have this ? so we have three presentations , and we'll go in order of participant number here . so we can have look at the working design first from participant two . so so you all know me , i'm the industrial designer . but click it on off ? and we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just every remote'll need .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , , take it away poppy .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . we've got teletext outdated . did you get any information on that ?
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? and cherries are fun , summery . what's that one there ? but , so but there would be cost implication on that , and as suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , suppose . i'll see if find them . sis yes , we'll have the slide-away . the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white play-doh . so that's where the colour buttons came from . an important consideration . so , sh this should be then . we could do it as we go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . so , by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we've got single curved case . we've got rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and . have push button interface . it's on the bottom row . if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . so , but the point would be that if we if we just did special , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . so it , is it is no , it's nine point seven i've got . just give us bit of switching around those on the electronics we got the sample sensor . so , that would that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . so , got set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it's easy to use . whether it's incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it's recognisable real reaction product . read the email again and it says it's evaluate the design as it is , , so we need to think about finance after we've evaluated that design . whether we're doing it in the wrong order or . suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . so , does this need to go up bit , 'cause we've got both the both the the speech . we got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and , we're going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too . i'd be happy with two . and the next one is i'll have to get it back up now . the next on , just sing about . easy to use . would've said yes . would go for one on that at this point in time .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're we're using to to achieve those goals ? like so so backlighting , that would be good . could have things like backlighting the buttons and like that . or even clear case . clear , that'd be . aye that would be good idea . in in slight subtle way . so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it . that'd be really good . is that what you mean ? or or there might be light running through it like mouse . you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power . so the power the battery in that sense , you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that but because the case is transparent so it gives it little bit of glow , doesn't make it freaky . they they emanate light through it . and then the other thing that we we're we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i'm thinking should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will wanna do . and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? like if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small . we really gotta wrap up so . it's small , and that we've got like the the slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that isn't that what we just said said we just have to decide now ? we can do that , . let's let's try and get the slogan on there , and .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . this is our agenda , we will do some , get to know each other bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as understand . now , we're developing remote control which you probably already know . we want it to be original , something that's people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , , trendy , appealing to wide market , but , not hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , even pooches should be able to use it .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so that fruit and vegetables thing . actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and so so , let me get this . t's trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics . but you're not gonna wear your remote control . , alright anyway . here we go .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , , the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's very important fact , 'cause if they say , , go home and think about it , that won't work . also mentioned was it should be it should have very short learning curve . and it could be sold by using slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . now should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be trend towards spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . i_d_ you want ? switch slide on your request . only have three slides , so . look at the just this . on some web pages to find some documentation and remote control is , as mentioned previously , you just have very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using wheel control . so was looking for that chip , which is very very standard , and looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . how do we make it look is the question . we have to make it look like fruit or vegetable . colour that remember some fruit , things like that . what about and for look and feel , what about piece of ice , with blue l_e_d_ inside ? the obvious thing is banana , . about pear , .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them bit bigger . the mute could possibly be bit smaller . you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue . and we chose v_ plus and v_ minus . all these things have cost implications .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ?
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that . just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have lost no . so just looking at what what craig craig's ideas are sorta tell me that what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this . so if we do say want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . it's like like find lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about is if you wanna just turn on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . so it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , . that's it's good idea . that's that's the but i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say , how do we collectively move on with it .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . then we will evaluate the product . and end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . so let's start with the cost aspect so so look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have standard battery , to have yellow banana shaped case with rubber material around it to be to feel spongy , and also at the different aspect like having wheel etcetera . and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros . so which is good , because we had price gap of twelve point five euros . six six six point five . is it fashion ? its its its fruit fruit shape . would say seven . and is very very design . it's fashion , because it's fruit , and we say that the , seven . we have the lightning , or the lighting . we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but so it's yellow . so you'll make the material transparent so that it lights up completely , or . it's very easy to would say seven . it's hard to miss it . is it is it robust ?
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ? and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . it'd probably quite expensive to put in . do you mind passing me my notepad . there you go . this is just the working design . this is just what how would go about it . try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . in practical way , we it is . we've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , back in the back of our minds we the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , , which one of the basics are you trying to target . are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? and the idea is just to get everybody to usually have have have design that's there as basic , so , , things that to start everything going . but everybody does have some idea , so don't think there's need for that . this finding things is little bit confusing , so i'll go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . you need some power source . battery , to keep it going . and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . it ties you down perhaps bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . like , voice recognition , . that might be constrained because that you might need to power microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . the basic thing is there's user interface where people punch button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . and that picks up an input from user , logic series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to , based on you push button , so will do something with button . so button is the power button , . and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . and that's about it in terms of my design . it's fairly general , and the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , like voice recognition , , , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having thing that we don't have enough power . so it's not really constraint in that sense , but these are functionally , , the base , what the technology has to do . so the rest of it we should you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? that's more relevant to discussion ? do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? are you are you all done ? more or less . ps , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . you have transmitter , an input device , logic chip , , like that . this would be . and like on the means since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ? alright , what's what in is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin . these these aren't technology options in that sense . this is just basic principles and basic components that are needed . the basic principle of . if you needed if you needed to add voice recognition , , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , , which you have microphone , the v_r_ and like that . so this just show how we're modularising the whole thing . so each component represents one function , but the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t_v_ . are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . ll worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market , so suspect it might be good idea just to restrict our our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it because it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha , . there might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular now , since we're talking about voice recognition . if somebody's gonna talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . it you may not require that , but , it's it's it's something very natural , , , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push button to start talking about it . then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . so in that sense , there's not really restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . not so much further down . and just clarification before we finish this . does is our controller is it have the option of being on standard frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? there's there's not much specific specific information , but that one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . because infra-red is something which everybody has . ll we've in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t_v_ , so that's what we should do for now . just to t_v_ , . something was wondering about was the power . is it worth considering like having like charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? there's there's , from from from component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . you need docking cradle , , for you to put it in to charge . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about . so just stick to to regular . so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs . or you can put it in the shared folder . you see the email ? you get email , . from the account manager . you have received the same email , ? it's for your to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . so each of us has role to do . assign your roles . for each for each one . in each we already have our role . for each person , . we can so there are three kinds of designs , that's all . so we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work . working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . and it should not be very costly . so about the about what ?
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype . here we have our prototype model . and you have some slides then ? we have also some slides . yes , and place some slides . we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa , and made some real good . if you can see this , and the stars are showing that . and , society will accept that . and making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and ultimate smell of it . but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the the modern material we can select . and it's practical . you can add your buttons . it's in option . so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off . then you ha you'll have volume control . so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ? that would be you . me and william worked on prototype , and william is going to make presentation on that . hold it like , so it looks crazy . can nick your whoa . second , i'll get it out . going bit crazy over here . you should have one of those things and you can just take it off . where are the hinges ? so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there . it's gonna have plastic body with standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like white or light blue . you able to look ? so it's flush . and working on the inside we've already said decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as , so that you could probably get bit of . so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's . we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . so you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , i'm here , . it it won't shout out i'm here . so what are you rating for this one , paw ? so that is eight . that brings it down to two , and simple , . ease of use . easy to use ? based on what you've said there , would say one , true . now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? it was it was voice voice recognition , . it was the i'm here thing , . and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . , that , that's feasible . see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . it might have influenced our choice . what's happening with the electronics ? it was regular chip on print and , no , no , no , the , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . chip on print . in the top , it's the number of .
now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations . we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . you want table to to yes yes you can can just talk about it or you can use the whiteboard if necessary . talk about it but have no slides or anything . 've just been presented with some research we've done in small focus group so , hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in remote control . it's probably can't email this to you , i've just got web page with some data on it . it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . seventy five seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . if you dump it in there . what's your username ? what's your username and password ? there we go . hopefully that's us ready to to go . so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so . and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . so i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . sh would you like to i'll just do it from here .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . just one thing . you said twenty-five minutes , but have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon , so you could hurry up bit it's true . can give you the no ? but don't have to say anything . when i'm drawing the orangutan . it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . it's an abstract drawing . it's and original .
everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . so , everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here . so , , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , , the thumb button is the power button . your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . three presentation , . shall go first again ? so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , . any of you think of like the the old torches which you wind up . there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more . and then there's solar cells . as final option .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow . or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do . so it's actually scale . one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven . and one is one , . if it's somewhere in between you put four .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features . so now we will have three presentations . so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_ . abdul al-hasred is my name . and the last point is trend watching by market expert . is is there anything you want to add ? is there any fruit that is spongy ? we we can have like pear is good , fit , or banana as you told . something like that . but that's not in the trend . you can make it it's not hard , the metal .
your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever . this is button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it it brings up the menu . and the base of the remote control , which has squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals .
and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control . it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . as usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company . it is in three step as . first the functional design . during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next . so first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some some notes or do some drawings . so who want to start ? no one else wants to , . so , want me to draw my favourite animal . don't really have favourite animal , but have one in mind , so i'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty the corner of white board .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . for the body design plastic , we could use the body , for the inside and rubber as padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . for the inside . so we decided on rubber casing for the plastic shell , variety of designs , . so , so . and it is just although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like shell that we discussed , just go for the colours . no we don't wanna be tacky if we've got different shape anyway the fact the the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the yes .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . it is in three step as . first the functional design . the second's conceptual design , and then the detailed design . during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next . so first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some some notes or do some drawings . so who want to start ?
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design . what's the the project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if if if anybody wants to briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . and am hemant , the industrial designer . for being here . so let's have look to the the agenda . so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control . it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . as usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company . it is in three step as . first the functional design . during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next . so first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some some notes or do some drawings . so who want to start ? no one else wants to , . so , want me to draw my favourite animal . don't really have favourite animal , but have one in mind , so i'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty the corner of white board .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . it's your best friend and your you can talk to dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between thief and person so these are the three unique features belong to dog . i'll have go . leave me space at the bottom , i'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on chair . since you have chosen the ones wanted to do , i'll have to have to go bit random .
she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other . it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . the tool training is to try out the white board , so you can draw your favourite animal and make list of its favourite characteristics . someone ha we have to this whiteboard , ?
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . the spider has spider lives in web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions . unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of of web . and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else . so they did this in in charlotte's web that movie that little t's actually book first but at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . so , that's my animal .
this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . the ipod , we really liked the look of that . we also had the kid's remote for simple idea . two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use . but we've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ? let me we've got forty minutes . so haven't made powerpoint presentation , , i'll use the whiteboard instead . you haven't made powerpoint , . , so i'll start off by i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are or highlighting or underlining them like that . let's hope the pen holds out . so i'll start again with brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of remote control and then we can probably discuss the various components . thes these are the kind different batteries that the company makes , ? does that mean like wind-up one ? so if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so they'll they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options . so the third one is the kinetic energy ones . you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v_ . and charging their remote , .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the detailed design phase will be doing product evaluation and so will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . hiya , i'm ryan . i'm the user interface designer .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ?
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . so again , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we'll we'll make final final decision . and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether it is practical to use long lasting one . and our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . and it it'll be , , prominently displayed as part of the the advertising literature that it's , , for life , guaranteed for life . now the the the internal chip and this is where need kate's expert advice and given that this has to to go to market as quickly as possible do we go for custom designed chip ? or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? i'm i'm i'm not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of already on the market that we can modify . but that that's that's your area of expertise . and then the , , the the overall design of the case is is is kendra's field and we we had some discussions last time as as to how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those da today . so we we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change of one sort . was thinking just for the volume , but what what do you think ? just for the volume , . we could , . 'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , , . it's it's it , it it it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there's no no possibility of confusing the two .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? and your role in this is ? and , lastly we have ? and you're going to be the user interface , is it ? user interface defin designer , yes . this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work . we're gonna have the three phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is detailed analysis of our design so far . you should also have your the lapel mic on as . there was this microphone as that you just somewhere so . now where do put the is this supposed to be clipped as ? the , it's just across there , that's it . it'll follow you if you you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , wouldn't worry too much . there you go . should have good range . excellent , very much . dave , if you'd like to have dash . the monkey , . the one this is somewhat oblique reference to my have three three year old daughter who who who who is affectionately known as miss monkey . monkeys have attitude . which is good thing . if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , . fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . now we better actually just get on with the the meat of the project . so i'm gonna that we've all used remote controls . any ideas of where you think new remote control could go into this market ?
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ? made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there's whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . did you give functional ? she said it was one . is it technologically innovative ? not really , not so much , 'cause we we don't have the screen , we don't have fancy chip . other than what it looks like , if it's really kinetic battery is big one , so . the r_r_ will be in colour as , so . interface , we're doing push buttons . and how many buttons do we have ? we have six . we've got five . no , five . didn't get any pictures . it's single curved . it's single curved . t's not the . it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important . that is important . twelve point five . twelve point five . so we're just just about there . so we're , . we're all set then . we're all set .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there . origi at first it was going to be cat . don't t's furry enough , so we'll make it fluffy rabbit . now now understand now , . see by the ears . , it's fluffy rabbit , blue . rabbits don't come in blue but .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design new remote control . so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . that mean it's very challenging project , and . so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ? is that alright ?
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line . we looked at the the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . and spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ? just trying to move mine now . courtney would you mind starting us off ?
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . first the functional design . the second's conceptual design , and then the detailed design . during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next . so first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some some notes or do some drawings . so who want to start ? no one else wants to , .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .
it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . not mouse , rat . that's it's clothes . it's ratty with with with very long tail . and your favourite characteristics of that animal . they're intelligent and they're cheeky and fantastic pets and very friendly . and they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .
and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . and no teletext . i'm not what teletext is but i'm assuming you do , so we don't wanna include that in this particular design . for reasons that don't really know . there's but it's the board so there you go . so given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our can sacrifice more function for better television remote . we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project . remote control works as follows . this is all pretty basic you . sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . user interface controls the chip , that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as . so my findings , did preliminary study here and found that too much metal in remote design could potentially interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just little bit for ju just thought . you could simply have slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out bit more is on one side or the other .
like in circular in shape or choice of material . 'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape . it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either . no no no not . it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . so should we go with that ?
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? usually when they say seven inch it's the diagonal . but even even that is like this big . dun dun one each . but , , . but we can we can cut it . you can cut the t_f_t_ screen .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ?
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . exp 'cause we we use we use , , everyday . and now having used remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or clearly better marked buttons , , things like that ? yes , feel the remote should be very compact . those which we get here nowadays it's very long . and and it should have multi-purpose .
here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever . this is button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it it brings up the menu . and the base of the remote control , which has squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , . yes if you feel it's . we just connect up . there we go . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager . we decided on the most important aspect required in remote control device and we'll come to that later .
no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off . it fell that's why . it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ?
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ?
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? who are you ? and we have technical problem . do we think in the in the wrong folder ? it is possible . you put it on . it was somewhere in something like this .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . we've got teletext outdated . did you get any information on that ? so got that in email form . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight . that's just for video , so we wouldn't need any of that . so we could get it down to what ? so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve we got fourteen that we need . which isn't really too many . that'll be quite easy to make user guide for fourteen button remote .
would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . so , sh this should be then . we could do it as we go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . so , by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we've got single curved case . we've got rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and . have push button interface .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so here here is another review here of the main things . also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . so if that's possible we might consider getting into it . and here as we move thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . people additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the the techie features how we can put that into unit which is which people like . young professional , . , it's the . did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ? what what do you think , craig ? the the older group . it does it does fit with the market that we're identifying , in terms of . we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause , there needs to be some selling point to it . so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like really high response to that . so we could say that was our target . twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as group as because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . people who are about wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on computer or mobile phone like that . so these are people who are gadgety , ? people who are growing up used to , in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would regular . so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . that that's that's good point . so so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition if we can . if we can . one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition now , because , based on what you've go everybody's saying , , you want something simple . why is that ? you want basic and you want something that's easy to use . speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . could it be an on off thing ? but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into particular technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . like if you want it on . where you can activate it and deactivate it ? so we should suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's it's something that can be used to fulfil function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . do you wanna give us your presentation and then then we can might have been good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're , exactly , . it's good t's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . it's something that's just occurred to me as if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people with physical disability as . and not losing . and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , they they're saying it's lose it in the couch . like we're what we're getting in into here is mating different design features together that they . reckon one problem with speech recognition is i've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . really , you've seen one before . do you think we need like further advances in that area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? it'd probably quite expensive to put in . do you mind passing me my notepad . there you go .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . and your role in this is ? and , lastly we have ? and you're going to be the user interface , is it ? user interface defin designer , yes . this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work . we're gonna have the three phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is detailed analysis of our design so far . you've all got the similar emails , believe , . which is good thing . and fr and from from the point of view of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . so like monkeys . and and thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . hardly what i'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . did you all receive that email ? so does anyone have any overall . what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be new product without something that people are very comfortable having now . so that's , from marketing perspective see see lack . and so we have to go , , in the other direction . what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . three presentations , you can go in any order you choose . shall we go in the order that you just did it ? it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . this is the main function . so then we asked some questions to them and we asked this question if they prefer an screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions . the first question . so that for the younger it's very important to have the yes and speech recognition . to have and voice . and and the others is not so important but we know that people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch lot t_v_ and who who wh can use lot this .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started .
can it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but you ask away . question on can ask question ? can we power light in this ? can we get strong enough battery to power light ? we could because the panel requires power , and the is form of light so that are you thinking are you thinking of of light in the sense of light light , or light in the sense of it glows frankenstein , it's alive . so one of the things we can just try and include is really good battery . like phone , like the backlight in phone . like phone , . whereas with phones , people charge them once week . we're gonna need to put in really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days . that's why the option of the the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? you wanna draw onto the . so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . sh we've got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ? i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , . no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you . what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel . so now more more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . have to remember it . so good so , let's talk about money . we are going to to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five euro euro . and our expected profit will be around fifty million euro . and we are trying to to have market all around the world . so not only for switzerland , but for the world .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ?
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . if you dump it in there . what's your username ? what's your username and password ? we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . we introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ bit more , mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as . it's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . thirteen point seven . what can we reduce ? let's have our buttons all be one colour . like the buttons . let's see what that would do . it's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ?
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs . or you can put it in the shared folder . you see the email ? so we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work . working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . and it should not be very costly . so about the about what ?
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . and cherries are fun , summery . what's that one there ? that's the mute . it it'd probably have to be labelled mute . but , we didn't have anything small enough to write . they're thinking for the first time , was hard to get the the actual labelling on the individual buttons . we just chose simple shapes for all them . the important ones are the volume ones . and whether it would , so as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in under twelve fifty or two and half twelve and half euros . so if you had to do presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? this this is yes , this is our presentation of the prototype . that's the pr . so , there's no redesign . so that should , so , seems to me that the thing that have to do is is quickly find that .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . that would be me . function eight it .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? let's have your let's get have the presentation ? so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them . so you don't you . which is ant anti-r_s_i_ . it should be . and it's also conformable to the size of your hand . if that's too big , it's rubber remote , so you can , change that . it's so cute . so does that what mesh with what you were hoping and for and expecting or does it , that's good thinking , . have one thing about it , but it's small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make right-handed one and left-handed one . but , that's don't see why that's not possible .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ? yes have it . so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . can put this on ? so we have to work out way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . this is to do this will not remove my microphone . we used some focus group surveys which went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . people have to then think about it and say got something there that want . that's really feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . third on the list , innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use . so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it . drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables . this is talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye-catching , really bold designs , and spongy feel . that's good idea . really like that idea . so what functionalities do you suggest for that ? for facing this problem ? in the present market saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing . i'm gonna draw it on the board then . it's in blue , and couldn't change it . we don't need it . it's fancy idea it's quite , but then don't , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna but , we can we can keep the idea if you we can see at later stage , , don't do you need the border ? we're we're desi we're designing and marketing television remote control unit . we're not designing something that you can plug in headset to and and connect to your laptop computer and . 's just an idea . done , catherine . let's plug you in , baby . the blue thing . , this is getting all . then you just have to do function eight and it should come up . it it just takes wee while . it just takes second .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . also since we're partners of the international remote control association , we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . that's more on the research end , but the marketing . so marketing , , how marketing , you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there . and as far as design goes , we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . do you have any ideas for what it should look like ? we could draw it up on the on the board over there .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . so presumably that might be an idea to put into . it's about that . and that's quite lot for remote control . my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . as you said they come with the t_v_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so we could think about colour ? make that might make it bit different from the rest at least . and as you say , we need to have some gimmick , so something like if you lose it and you can whistle , those things ? the the keyrings , . because we always lose our remote control .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? you have no over . there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? and so no speech as because it it would delay too much the development process . it's going to delay but it will be . because user could say c_n_n_ and it would go c_n_n_ . that would be . but eight months is really long and we can just . so will will so we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break here are the individual action you are required to do but you will be recalled to the actions by email but you can take notes if you if you want but the instruction will be sent .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ? made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there's whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . now it's twelve . we , they are . what was our target price again ? twelve point five . twelve point five . twelve point five . so we're just just about there . so we're , .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies .
could could jump in and suggest something quickly ? i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . is there anything anybody's unsure about ? just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , know that the designers are gonna be working with play-doh on that . so that'll be that'll be good . and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ?
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for . and so will show you some of the results from that , which will be helpful . here are some of the findings . they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . which is fairly significant number would say . and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get remote that would look fancy .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place .
just down here ? what are we doing next ? we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . away i'm making some assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . so i'm wondering away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or . like how much does , , remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one . we've got trend watching , that's you . it's components design . the case le that's what wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . but later on we found out that it can be rubber as , or titanium or even wood . so we decide what it's gonna be . we need the infra-red transmitter .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . so we've got forty minutes . and then do we get to make remote control ? 'cause we missed out . or or that we have to have some special colour . so that's alright . we we'll leave it at that and then i'll take send it back to management and say we weren't quite about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , . we have , . so did we lose on our evaluation criteria , as result of doing that ? no , don't .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , . there we go . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager . we decided on the most important aspect required in remote control device and we'll come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ? let me we've got forty minutes . so haven't made powerpoint presentation , , i'll use the whiteboard instead . you haven't made powerpoint , . , so i'll start off by i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are or highlighting or underlining them like that . let's hope the pen holds out . so i'll start again with brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of remote control and then we can probably discuss the various components . does that mean like wind-up one ? so if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so they'll they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options . so the third one is the kinetic energy ones . you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v_ . and charging their remote , . and stop worrying about the whole r_s_i_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just yay .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it . then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this . bra that's that's like it . like the the the the logo on there as . it's very prominent . it is very prominent . so this is the . so here i'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , and then the volume controls are here and here . and that's you must have very long shirts . that's way far down lapel mic . wha , , alright . lapel lapel lapel . that's almost crotch mi cr dear dear . that's it's down , it's quite close .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . then there is chip and still the sender .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? and , lastly we have ? and you're going to be the user interface , is it ? user interface defin designer , yes . this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . this is how today seems to be going to work . we're gonna have the three phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is detailed analysis of our design so far . you've all got the similar emails , believe , . what can say ?
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ?
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . so the the goal is to have remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . so the design step will be divided in three main points . first it will be the functional design . third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . and then we will move to conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and like that . you should if you want to react about this wonderful drawing i'll let you comment . can give you the no ? but don't have to say anything . when i'm drawing the orangutan . it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . it's an abstract drawing .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . so let this wonderful thing .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ? just trying to move mine now . courtney would you mind starting us off ? so we can go ahead and go to the next . so what they want . now customers want fancy versus functional . about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . so the customer is confused . they exactly what they want . they want us to tell them . they want everything , but simply . so we can go to next . so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . so if we want to go with that and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . really , the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and , you'd want like softer touch . address some of that issue , , with my presentation . but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , if we really want to go with that , because it is just trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just few months , because . people don't buy new remote every so often . so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put big on-off button else in the middle , it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's . so it's classically retro . so that's just an idea if you like it . ready for the next slide ? and that's it . which one is it ? interface concepts , no ? interface concepts new . either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there . mine will always read copy of something or other . copied mine before sent it over . you'd you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's v_ , and so yo you're feeling v_ like volume up . what it really is is v_ and what it you is is down , because the down arrow . and so it's like criticism you'd probably turn that the other way up . but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be , iffy , old-fashioned in way . either that or just have it by shape , you have specific triangular shape that you're looking at the up and down arrow . or like , , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . have four of those remotes . what's the title ? it'll be copy of component design . that looks like it . so basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . so next slide , . suggested casing options . we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , , very specific to the customer . options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . don't think anyone's gonna go for wood one , because splinters . that would be amazing , though , .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera .
no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ? and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ? are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as . did miss something ?
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ?
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ?
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? we all have presentation again , so if we go through those and then .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . and one thing particularly like is if you are not moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . there is way around that , but my residence now the the television you have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so it's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , and that's if we're gonna make remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like lithium battery that would last lot longer than like double a_s . something that doesn't . like tho those are the batteries that are used in lot of m_p_ three players now and that thing .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria .
we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and you're all thinking of , my , because we're only given forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . so we're going to make very fast track . and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . so the first thing have to do is close this so that get to where is it ? need to open mine .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ? then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . and we've got forty minutes to do that in . so would say ? the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . quickly jotted them down . so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . so the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . how however , our our remote control would only be dealing with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . so he he here is functional overview of the remote control . there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i'll basic go over to the . but then other functionalities could be just there could be menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu . and , the last question had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . so at the for the time being that's that's all . if you have questions , and also it's it's other question is because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . if that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had decent case for that we really t's important to include video and d_v_d_ , could get back to them and see . it's it's just whether it's worth arguing about . so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , but , it's up there . the remote control . so the the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ . this is pink because was copying and pasting the table , and didn't have time to white it out again . don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls . now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . we need both . what wh what was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that want to go onto channel number forty five . that would be another way to do it . but but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it and and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on remote control though ? so that you can yell at it , . , so you have to have the remote control . it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , . but then the remote control the idea is it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep near yourself . no , but was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , and not to yell at it from the distance . so wh another thing that can be used is that there can be beeper button on the t_v_ , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . that's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but you could have something , but if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v_ , some like two if you bought it in two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v_ . 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . the , but it solves the problem of having different noises . we're gonna have to wrap this up .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ?
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . to meet you poppy . my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer . will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . hi , i'm genevieve .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . so before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having good look also , because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c_d_ player , m_p_ three player like any electronic devices . they really want to have something good , having good design in their hands , so , yes , all this . what do we think what do we think good size would be for this ? so , we're looking for . and , other instructions will come from the personal coach . which will probably just usurp what said so shapes and colours and how to make it attractive . so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? and you look at competition and design . so we have . and no doubt we'll get . we'll get warnings for next meetings as .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design . you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs . and if you look at lot of the universal remotes out on the market , know we're working on television remote , but lot of the universal remotes out there have have these screens which helps when you're using multiple devices suppose because you can have multiple functions different functions on the screen at different times . but the thing that find most interesting about this remote control , and it's difficult to to see in the slide , but it has scroll wheel on it , which is like mouse scroll wheel , which is it's really important design aspect is it's 'cause the thing is what what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . and the the simplest thing that remote control does is it just change the change the channel . change the channels . now the that scroll wheel is actually pretty pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'cause know when when use the remote to change the channel very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . then there is chip and still the sender . the firm supplies simple , regular and an advanced circuit board . and there's different prices according to each . so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there's small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . and that would require more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? the components are exactly the same . like what you said , the most input that's needed is in the user interface . the rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . like you said time to market was problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost . and the power is factor of that . and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how more how you hold rather than the actual use using the the remote control because like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . so it's just matter of working out space . so three things , cost , complexity , and the size . these are the three things that will have an impact on you . so just go through it in the components . these are the options that are available to you , i'm not very about the voice thing 'cause got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are . it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . it said something about sensor but never clarified that . so if you could see the other email that they sent you , 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa so your basic components are buttons , and you have wheel available , like mouse scroll wheel , there's an display , these are quite standard things . they're standard , aren't they ? no they're the sense that these are all the options available for you . i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again bit later . then there's how the case actually looks . it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , don't think you can use them in combination , but could check back for you , but don't think you can actually use them in combination . we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , wasn't i'm not very about the titanium . they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . the rubber was restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from cost perspective and complexity just to use one . as opposed to two . and the other components are logic chips , again i'll i'll go back to the component chips . the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit and that impacts cost . don't think the logic chip has issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . power consumption should be about the same . the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options . the first one is standard battery . the second one is more of gimmick then actually useable thing , it's wind-up , crank . i'll clear one of these things for you . just by moving it . but that that might be something that's more of look and feel decision because don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . whatever it is you still need battery 'cause don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . the other ones are solar powered cell , which may not be idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . so like what said , you probably need like battery and something else . and the kinetic one for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's sales gimmick . from marketing gimmick it it's technology thing , it's shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it . you have you had those balls , those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , that might be gimmick combined with rubber . just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , just so . my from my role , don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , something comfortable to hold , small and slim that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , like phone , too small phone . and the other thing is from production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so . let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard , the panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . the case with rubber case you can't have the solar panels . with the titanium case , let me just check that , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood . it can't be curved . so that's again , don't think you can use them in combination , especially the titanium suspect they're very fixed to particular need .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ? is that alright ? keeps coming off . how do we sta wa how do we start ? does anybody know ? so that's this , . are we free to take notes . just hang on second everybody . haven't actually looked at this yet . haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents . it's he said to me when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . there is no no negotiation possible in this matter . so we have to consider that . so anna , you can have your presentation .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use .

time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . my name's bob mor . and you are ? in the project ? so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design new remote control . so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . that mean it's very challenging project , and . so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . and we are trying to to have market all around the world . so not only for switzerland , but for the world . the we expect production cost of maximum twelve point fifty euro . per unit , . so we can start today to have first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? so , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you what is your idea .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . hope that clicks in , i'll just i'll hold it on , . dear , what happened there ? hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . again this is off the top of my head , was gonna do big cat too , . dear , it doesn't look what like what want it to be .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . we should make big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . that's very good . so something like that we we should do . and people the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having plastic look , hard look . that's what we predicted anyway . so so that they could play with it while handi while handling it . so , i'll take this out now then . so there are lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and i'll i'll give you the , , technical considerations for those . there you go . looks like it . was just thinking the self same thing . and i'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . that what our data shows that , so this this the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people now spongy . i'm i'm not about the banana idea . so spongy banana re . that that does it does seem bit again childish . just draw on the fruit and vegetable shape .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so that fruit and vegetables thing . actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and so so , let me get this . t's trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics . but you're not gonna wear your remote control . , alright anyway . here we go .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs .
we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons . no can do . we could just go with . normal coloured buttons . do you want colour differentiation here ? no that's not the button we're talking about .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting . alright so let's have look here . so this was the method that i've taken . here we go . what wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is want to show you all the background information have that we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . and and then sorta go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information , and then bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . so i've tried to take whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are are in sync and are important to our our project plan that we have so far , and then initiate discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other other elements of the of the project . does that make sense , tha that strategy ? that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why suggested we get in this . aye fair point definitely . so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br television remote control , fancy look and feel , , and not , it specified , not functional look or or feel , fancy . however , this is where we kinda have to be very , , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . so that tells me that we have to find way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary functional bits to it . and third priority for ease of use , so again that gives us general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i'll just say away as bit of foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of marketing , is that what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up , what , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? that's where we're gonna go with this . then there's the other aspect of the back the the market research have here is on fashion style , , which as we've is priority . top european fashion trend that read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , , especially in clothes and furniture . and when first saw that , do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get into it , or we completely steer away from it , do what ? so my my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . 'cause what we're in what we're in is partly home decor , partly something like computer , so we might wanna be careful about how how quickly we create like remote control in the shape of an apple , that would be pushing it . and then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . so probably lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , that'll be in our favour . so these this is the summary of everything . style is number one thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . innovative design technology's also must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that's the way interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i've written at written at the bottom to give us context of discussion , mac ipods , something which is , i'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . what mac ipod is ? that's true , . i'm thinking however mac ipod is last year's because it's very hard and glassy and glossy , so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of mac ipod and we're then making it more of like more of like comfortable type of or more of like more vibrant to friendly thing to have . and then so this is with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . like like we think of some thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like marketing identity . does that make sense ? so so like threw out few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . like the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like theme to it would be like like lemon like that , something which is , like you see lot in in other areas . like see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it's just just an idea . i'm thinking we could incorporate some of these features into fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like like something to do with like lighting within it . like just within the simple sense , when you pick up phone and touch button it lights up , usually the buttons light up . how can we build on that ? like it could light up in different colours or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers so . anyway those are that's all have , but hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into . craig do you wanna plug yours in then ?
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . that would be me . function eight it . there we go . i'm very excited by this one actually had lot of fun doing it . this is where you look at what does it take to make remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . so , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as whole .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you . just what needed was something exciting . remember , i'm an old man . ready to go ? so we've got our conceptual design meeting . i'm old as .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer .
no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . didn't get any pictures . it's single curved . it's single curved . t's not the . it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important . that is important .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ? for it , for it . that's not you . that's how the . this is , this is very high-powered here , double-clicking , there we go . so the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer , or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and what limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop remote with voice recognition , i_e_ that had vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as remote since you could just use your voice . that would include some mostly just the simple design features for television operation but with slide or fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . and the the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing prototype for us to look at . that's sorted , back to the main meet here , , go ahead and take it away . we have assembled our prototype , . what's to be said about it ? we took into account lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , . some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , . this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , we decided those were the most important buttons . no but it's couple years off at least . it's pos possible new product . but that's that sums up the main features of our of the remote , if you have any questions or whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature . did we come in under budget ? we did , . this cost to put this into production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? am disappointed didn't get note back from my personal coach . as you write your personal coach . but didn't get response so we'll see . what if you get response two or three months from now ? that would be kinda creepy . that'd be weird .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . what's the big blue thing ? that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button . and then it also has digit for muting the and then then you can also there's numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we t's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . that certainly does . so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them . something that the whiteboard thingy , that's . but pen with camera on it , don't t's such new thing . it's or in such new idea . it would be different if it was hand writing recognition , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on computer screen as picture file rather than actual text . they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . we should end this , since we're off off topic .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs . or you can put it in the shared folder . you see the email ? the very no , no the first one . no , didn't get it . you get email , . from the account manager . you have received the same email , ? it's for your to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . so each of us has role to do . assign your roles .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . the firm supplies simple , regular and an advanced circuit board . and there's different prices according to each . so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there's small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . and that would require more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you . what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel . so now more more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . and i'm really intrigued by the idea of kinetic battery . solar don't think would be such good idea , because how often are you that your remote control will get certain amount of light . but this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that simple just shaking it around will make it work , that that would be very interesting thing . but we'd also wanna go for simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . we really only need regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using an . so we want to be aware of not making things overly technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . that's what have for options .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , , the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's very important fact , 'cause if they say , , go home and think about it , that won't work . also mentioned was it should be it should have very short learning curve . also mentioned was different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and some holder for the for the item . francino who is our interface designer has mentioned that the that it , , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have channel lock . particularly with small children that they couldn't watch channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped . if you are watching french program and you would like to have subtitles in english , then there should be channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen . then there should there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be memory switch . there should be mute button . suddenly if if if viewer he gets telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the t_v_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v_ . now the most important feature would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control . the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . what's the function of this button . it makes the the interface really graphical user interface . ea easy to use . so next one . so use the button , the mouse .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users . with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before . people thought their remotes were ugly , that remotes zap lot . they only use finite amount of buttons . and that they often lose the it's easy to lose remote . which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . and that it should look different than what's out there . mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably gimmick , that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . then the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote . the simple versus the the complex . unfortunately wasn't given too much information . was given brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that got from that . the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which we've already discussed before . the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . these are all things we've already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . so that's for the for the scroll wheel . it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i'd say rather not go for for that . let's see now . solar cells cannot be used on curved or latex surface or remote control . but that's not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , assume ?
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . then marketing strategy of the company . as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental . so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , like keeping keeping in mind all the safety issues . so now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . i'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on board . the board working again , is it ?
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . this is our agenda , we will do some , get to know each other bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as understand .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea . so , and gabriel . i'm catherine with c_ . c_a_t_h_ e_r_ i_n_e_ . e_l_ is it ? and you're r_e_i_s_s_ . 's just bit nicer calling people by their names .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the marketing expert . and am hemant , the industrial designer . for being here . so let's have look to the the agenda . so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ? at the same time , if it's dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or you can let them to do that . and you want for coming back to one point you want to let the user to programming the keys ? two thirty five supposed to finish . some of them ? and isn't that too difficult for the we want if we still want the r_c_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise . no but the if you give it depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . that would be me . function eight it .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design . what's the the project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if if if anybody wants to briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so . my name's andrew i'm i'm the market research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and i'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and haven't had whole lot of experience in this thing before but i'm so i'll be working on the design . at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so . i'm just open to being creative . i'm katie , i'm the industrial designer and i'll just be presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and . very very quickly , this don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's think tank .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert . hope saved it . so , , this is my name . know this name . we met before . so as , you you already know me , sammy benjo . am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ?
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . so let's have look to the the agenda . so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control . it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . as usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . thought my leadership was crap personally . excuse me , am allowed to say that ? you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . you were fine . you did good job leading . 'm never gonna do management position , know that now .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control .
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ?
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line . let's see , minutes from the last meeting . we looked at the the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . and spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . the ipod , we really liked the look of that . we also had the kid's remote for simple idea . two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use . but we've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? we all have presentation again , so if we go through those and then . so yes including the power supply as . i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , . any of you think of like the the old torches which you wind up . there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ?
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . it's thinking about it . it'll get there . so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices . findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual . there're some special ones available , like this one here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that we need to watch out for is v_ in volume because people some bring little picture of what ours could look like . so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is slide button , like you have on mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway . it should work like this . so will try to get my presentation running . can't help you with that .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the detailed design phase will be doing product evaluation and so will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . and the detailed design like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . that's about it . i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in in this project . in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . suppose we'll work together on that one . do we have any ideas of of let's just throw out some ideas of what remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . function of remote control is just just , change channels is its main function . so we want it to be t_v_ remote or do we want it to to do other things besides just be television remote ? suppose you try make it universal remote for could work on all electrical products in in one person's house . but , , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . they all work on the same prin principle as sorta like don't actually know .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so this is just introductions . my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . forgot to say i'm the project manager but figured you all knew that already , so . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . it's your best friend and your you can talk to dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between thief and person so these are the three unique features belong to dog . i'll have go . leave me space at the bottom , i'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on chair . since you have chosen the ones wanted to do , i'll have to have to go bit random .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? am the project manager for today . so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . yes opening , acquaintance , tool training , the tools are , , we already the tool is really our the computer , as far as see . we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . project plan , that falls under the same heading . don't think we have any discussion at this point .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . so that's gonna be you catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . just connecting this . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing . i'm gonna draw it on the board then . it's in blue , and couldn't change it .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ?
so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like really high response to that . so we could say that was our target . twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as group as because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . they have bit of expendable income to spend on this thing . perhaps that age group is significant as because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about . so just stick to to regular . so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . do you wanna recap on that , craig ?
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so this is just introductions . my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . forgot to say i'm the project manager but figured you all knew that already , so . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? suppose draw an animal , . uh-oh there goes the ten . they sleep all day , they're easy to draw . do you wanna anything ? if the the . had the cat as , but i've got spare one . the pen is running out of two million . so i'll use the spare one . but it's harder to draw . and the other thing is not needs to be . do you needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? like hand hand held size , . don't think you need but definitely not . not not huge , but . it can't be that hard to put some noise on it .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line . let's see , minutes from the last meeting . we looked at the the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ?
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . how do hook my screen up ? you might have to disconnect rose . there's wee wee plug just just that one there that's it , . where does it go ? i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ? and then you have to press function eight it is on your laptop . 's move on to the next presentation on effects . was that you ? have unscrewed it ? user interface , . here we go . and that's in the shared , if did it , if anyone wants to look at it . it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . so hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ? so you are you saved your your presentation somewhere ? so you're four ? investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you . what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel . so now more more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . so , but you also have to you have to also have , fit all the buttons and . it's , it the thing is you have normally with with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on cylindrical device it may be difficult to to build . don't it will be rolling lot . but li like your idea that we shouldn't have lot of buttons buttons so do you want an with twenty five euros ? and you you you will not have pla enough lot of place to put on banana also . you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype . so we we have sample chip . check that number also . so it's simple chip ? like simple chip , . simple chip , . four buttons at least . and then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . there we go . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager . we decided on the most important aspect required in remote control device and we'll come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . now should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be trend towards spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . so that affects the exterior design . they're they're expensive , they don't the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , but the it's they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop if you if you have the size you'd need to charge remote wouldn't be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so . what price are we looking at for presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? it's twelve point another question is like . they're not designed practical-wise . calculators you don't really throw around lot whereas remotes you do , they can they do , they they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller . for the body design plastic , we could use the body , for the inside and rubber as padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . for the inside . so we decided on rubber casing for the plastic shell , variety of designs , . so , so . and it is just although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like shell that we discussed , just go for the colours . no we don't wanna be tacky if we've got different shape anyway the fact the the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the yes .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
i'm not the one in the middle is very attractive . it's very , if you're . it's very big , . it's hard it's easy for you to remember it . or to recognise it , . we'll have big discussion suppose after that , so .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . we want it to be original , something that's people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , , trendy , appealing to wide market , but , not hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , even pooches should be able to use it . , first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , i'll go first , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . so , i'll leave space for everyone else . we're running out of blue . this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . hope that clicks in , i'll just i'll hold it on , . dear , what happened there ? hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . again this is off the top of my head , was gonna do big cat too , . dear , it doesn't look what like what want it to be .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim .
you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim . we are creating new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control . the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . what's the function of this button . it makes the the interface really graphical user interface . ea easy to use . so next one . so use the button , the mouse .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . then we will evaluate the product .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . yes but we yes , we should phone him . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ?
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ? the customers , .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so this is just introductions . my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . forgot to say i'm the project manager but figured you all knew that already , so . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . if we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . so you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? or just draw it ? why don't we do both . we ought to decide who starts and all that . does anyone they wanna draw ? can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? selling price is twenty five euro . profit aim fifty million euro . lot , two two two million , two mi no , more four million . and it t's the profit so if profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . it is lot .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ? for it , for it . that's not you . that's how the . this is , this is very high-powered here , double-clicking , there we go . so the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer , or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and what limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop remote with voice recognition , i_e_ that had vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as remote since you could just use your voice . that would include some mostly just the simple design features for television operation but with slide or fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . and the the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing prototype for us to look at . that's sorted , back to the main meet here , , go ahead and take it away . we have assembled our prototype , . what's to be said about it ?
we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have labelled . like on the side of it . if it's just up and down volume or channel . if it's just up and down . but is that for which ?
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . you can pull it out first , . we've got the two scroll wheels here which one on the the left for the volume and the one on the for for the channel and underneath we have the the turbo button which is in like trigger position for for pressing quite naturally . what's the use of the turbo button already ? this is when you when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to to skip past channels that you quickly rather . an then you stop when you stop it stops . when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . how you turn that one to zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ? we have to have it . we'd be giving up on the kinetic . we should , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov , . that would give you one less . but you reckon that the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . clunky in what sense , like heavier ? it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size . see , so it's more just basic . got very few buttons on it and , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? up the numbers , or the up down ? wou would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , would anybody disagree with that ? what else , so don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , like brightness and contrast ? es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising . we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? is that what we're we're doing ? we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that . just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have lost no . so just looking at what what craig craig's ideas are sorta tell me that what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this . so if we do say want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . it's like like find lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about is if you wanna just turn on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . so it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , . that's it's good idea . that's that's the but i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say , how do we collectively move on with it . on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to channel . and is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness . another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? is it is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , , they get ours and it's doesn't have that . it's as optional functions . if that'd be problem . could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be device . this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from manufacturer's point of view , from person designing the device , but from point of view of person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like so what we could have is like three buckets , , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . it might help with the visualisation . and it would actually help with the component build as . because the on off also goes , , like on off like power , not on off sound . not on off video . although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's mute button , , so you you have you have choice of putting it on to others or device . device is anything which we can't categorise , . so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi . we put it out . anything to do with what you hear , . you you put that into audio . and then visual , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , like that . and then video is anything that you can see . and then suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are bit more . like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get bigger market share and bigger audience . so method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . so in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for . let's see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what . and so will show you some of the results from that , which will be helpful . here are some of the findings . they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . which is fairly significant number would say . and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get remote that would look fancy .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . this is our agenda , we will do some , get to know each other bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as understand . now , we're developing remote control which you probably already know . we want it to be original , something that's people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , , trendy , appealing to wide market , but , not hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , even pooches should be able to use it . we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , i'll go first , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . so , i'll leave space for everyone else . we're running out of blue . i'm not gonna ask you to , i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be tiger . and see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . now , who would like to go next ?
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ? and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting . why don't get that ? screwed in quite tightly . what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gonna try incorporate it but we hadn't made definite decision on that ? should also point out that the the final objective of this meeting is to reach decision on the concepts of the product . so that's the end result hopefully . alright so is it function eight ? hopefully appear in wee second . up there we go . like phone , like the backlight in phone . like phone , . whereas with phones , people charge them once week . we're gonna need to put in really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days . that's why the option of the the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? so you could trigger that to light , like said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness . let's just go back to the marketing ideas for start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . what does everybody think about does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? that's the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? we could go for like not fruit shape but very curvy type shape . you could have the same texture and colour as fruit . so do are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ? probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much . he made that . and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow . and then the the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the the colour , you said company colour yellow . if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? does it need with square thing wha 'cause that will help narrow down the choice of like fruit . like in circular in shape or choice of material . 'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape . it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either . no no no not . it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . so should we go with that ? and colour-wise what does everybody think ? it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , . or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . that might scare me . any thoughts on that ? that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought . do we need an display ? what what's the functionality of that ? but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? what would it achieve ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of . l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about . and the the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is . that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday . so so no need for an display ? i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? that would make it very complex . we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there need for the remote control to to talk back ? if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back . you could put game on it . does anybody disagree with that ? when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control . so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , do you wanna group them into head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . what else do you need to talk about ? where would you physically position the buttons ? that that has some impact on on on many things . you wanna draw onto the . so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . sh we've got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ? i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , . no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just . so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as . so that's what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ? as for the case , discussed that know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel . and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're we're using to to achieve those goals ? like so so backlighting , that would be good . could have things like backlighting the buttons and like that . or even clear case . clear , that'd be . aye that would be good idea . in in slight subtle way . so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it . that'd be really good . is that what you mean ? or or there might be light running through it like mouse . you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power . so the power the battery in that sense , you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that but because the case is transparent so it gives it little bit of glow , doesn't make it freaky . they they emanate light through it . and then the other thing that we we're we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i'm thinking should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will wanna do . could we use like jog dial , like just round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? the question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? do you want to roll it like that ? do you want to roll it like that ? 'cause in mouse your hand's in position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? why don't we do it like mouse then ? if you're holding it in your hand you could do you think ? that's very unnatural motion to . can you imagine you have to scroll lot . it might work for volume , and some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels . if you have telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . you just roll . i'm all for them actually , they're quite very quick to to use . so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design ? and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? like if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small . we really gotta wrap up so . it's small , and that we've got like the the slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that isn't that what we just said said we just have to decide now ? we can do that , . let's let's try and get the slogan on there , and . and then like jo and then like jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like like here , in with the it would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . so you wanna expand the shape of the that that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're handed you might be locking yourself in . or just fit it in like down the middle here . could could jump in and suggest something quickly ? and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . anything you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? is everybody happy about what they're gonna be doing ? the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be . one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite big impact on the thing that's what was thinking the slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . incorporating logo is quite straight forward . there's lots of space for it but it's also marketing and function . that's design thing that you can can discuss , . , and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . to make something flush with the case ? something bit more flush , , or have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also plastic i've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . sp kinda grippy ? feel like fruit . they feel like , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , little bit like . kinda like that .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . let's see what this thing does . does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? we came up together , we're good . are we ready to start ? it's now quarter of four . this is another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to sarah present the evaluation criteria . we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and you're all thinking of , my , because we're only given forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ?
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . and you're going to be the user interface , is it ? user interface defin designer , yes . this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed flip-open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . three presentations , i've got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ? is it if postpone that til later , want to get access to little bit more information , is that ? no that's fine , that's fine . i'll go first . so , bigger so you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . for u_s_ and all you can have slightly bigger remote control and in japan and all you need to have small , . we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , . the internal engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , . it's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , . i'm concerned , when you read the the r_s_i_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , don't think just moving your finger around on small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still question mark issue how we deal with that .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ? made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there's whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . we have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . that was knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist . but in other things , it'd be really good . thi , that's awesome . are the costs within the budget ? is the project evaluated ? now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . so , this is the product kids , we've created something really interesting and that we have market for it , especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . yes but we yes , we should phone him . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents . can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have design . you are here . ma then you can start now with presenting your your designs . so will start by the the basic one that fits into eight euros actually , , seven eight euros , and first for both they have special shape , the designer can explain better than me , but it's like surf board . and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t_v_ , the web , and it's interesting shape because unconsciously people want to to surf when they see this . and also it's not too far from mobile . to audio and to video on demand . yes and and and then you get feedback via the . this is the orange button , the microphone . and here is small l_e_d_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as was talking earlier . and then we have cover , you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add tactile thing to this cover . crazy dis designer , .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line . let's see , minutes from the last meeting . we looked at the the trends . the ipod , we really liked the look of that . we also had the kid's remote for simple idea . two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use . but we've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ? my name is eileen . am the project manager for today . so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . yes opening , acquaintance , tool training , the tools are , , we already the tool is really our the computer , as far as see . we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . project plan , that falls under the same heading . don't think we have any discussion at this point . here is what this thing should be . this thing we are gonna design is new remote control . should be original , trendy , and , , user friendly . so you wanna make some notes of that . after we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? so that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . you wanna go eileen and whether you without hanging yourself . i'll see what do . and it likes to sit like that . and you're francine , ? yes , i'm francina . would you like like just to see how it feels , so that you have little idea ? am supposed to wipe off that or . in no , no . that's the end of the show . so we have , we have twen two two two three minutes . any questions at this point ? you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions , , you can . have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . how about you people ?
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . can have the laptop over here , or ? you have to come here . have to get up . it should stay . should stay in the square here . so i'm gonna present some findings of study we conducted into what users want in this remote control . you can put it here . that's , it's jus . so first of all we what we did is we conducted an experiment with hundred test subjects . we put them in in our usability laboratory and got them to , , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . so the major things we found out was that users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . and you can see they're used hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , , while the user's watching t_v_ . the closest button that was used , the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , , all the other , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , , approx less than or equal to one times per hour . we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . and they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having very very high relevance . and the audio and picture settings had very that the users thought that the audio and picture settings were very weren't very important to them , and they used them very infrequently as . so we asked users what what frustrates them the most about current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . then we will evaluate the product . and end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . so let's start with the cost aspect so so look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have standard battery , to have yellow banana shaped case with rubber material around it to be to feel spongy , and also at the different aspect like having wheel etcetera . and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros . five point five average . does it , techne technological aspect . so after , the technological aspect ? so we we said we have new technological thing with wheel . we have the wheel . we also have the rubber material , which make it like new also . it's very easy to would say seven . it's hard to miss it . is it is it robust ? it's rubber , made of rubber , it's it's more rubber than other remote control . it's ru it's rubber . the only problem there might be which know , if it's very sensitive , they will , , .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . first want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . let's go ahead and , back , previous . so what wanna do now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint .
this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere . and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? that's the thing , i'm i'm not because on the the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea . it's good idea . so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ . and then actual numbers for channels as , . you say that's required one or requested one ? which was that ? would you like the channels like the the numbers on thing , , . up the numbers , or the up down ? wou would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , would anybody disagree with that ? what else , so don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , like brightness and contrast ? es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising . we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? is that what we're we're doing ? we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . till the meeting . this is what we have left . also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 'cause hate that when they have too many buttons and has to have enough functions but like , you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . button and the button , they don't do anything . you what if may be little fancy but what if it had like little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . that would be .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ?
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . there we go . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager . we decided on the most important aspect required in remote control device and we'll come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . what an original idea . do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? no no you should write the name . you should if you want to react about this wonderful drawing i'll let you comment . can give you the no ? but don't have to say anything . so hope that it helps you in the process of designing remote control . that's is there matter for new remote control ? let's move on . so here the financial objective of our project . that is to say to to have production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have selling price of twice that price in order to target profe profit of fifty million euros . if it's trendy , original fulfil the user needs .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you . i'm gonna open . i'm gonna talk for bit about what we're gonna do . i'm gonna take some notes . we're gonna all do presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . when say hopefully , we have to . so i'm gonna let you talk before we make decisions .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so i've been looking at the components design . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . and we'll need to custom desi design circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . but once we come up with design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , the ipod-style wheel . the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long . and we will once again have poppy as our first presenter .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? and then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . first we're gonna start off by using our tools . and the whiteboard thing , do you wanna give that try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . we could , we could on here . alright , let's go forward then .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time . you're participant four . i'm participant four believe . and now full screen . there we go . at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set something else cute like coffee pot or one other appliance or lamp . can can at this point interject something ? have to wind up ? we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate that's the teletext , because that's outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the t_v_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex task to to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market . complicated , , . it's like , it's like timer it's like lock to the television . timer , , , . and then you can use timer as . now have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how how does it work .
so we come again for the the second meeting . for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one . and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we have got new project requirement . so teletext becomes outdated . so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . and we should have our image in the in the design . so , let's start with the the industrial designer . so have powerpoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so you can reach it from here . or you can use the whiteboard if you want . just go to explorer . we have so let's move to to user interface design . so you can open three . participant during the weekend . so so i'm working on the technical functions design . can you show the next slide . so the the purpose is to to find the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ?
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ?
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren .
during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next . so first , we have to to train ourself with all the the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some some notes or do some drawings . so who want to start ? no one else wants to , . so , want me to draw my favourite animal . don't really have favourite animal , but have one in mind , so i'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty the corner of white board .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so i've been looking at the components design . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , i'll go first , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . so , i'll leave space for everyone else . we're running out of blue . i'm not gonna ask you to , i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be tiger . and see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . now , who would like to go next ?
i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . but not let that confine us technologically . any comments on all of that ? one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our our target audience , our target market . so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? who wou who would have the money to spend . where's the money , . if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , don't i'm not really how much that will retail at . and who watches t_v_ . but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . so , who do you think we're aiming this at ? 'cause twenty five euros for remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , . is that too is that lot of money to buy an extra remote or replacement remote ? so not the high end range , but middle , middle up-ish . you pay , what , ten ten quid for remote ? like simple replacement , . this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is table of what people would pay more for certain feature . just gives us rough idea of where the the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is . mostly focused around the twenty five age group . so do you think we're we're aiming at fairly young market then ? young professional , . , it's the . did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? they have bit of expendable income to spend on this thing . perhaps that age group is significant as because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . people who are about wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on computer or mobile phone like that . so these are people who are gadgety , ? people who are growing up used to , in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would regular . so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . that that's that's good point . so so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition if we can .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much . he made that . and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow . and then the the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the the colour , you said company colour yellow . if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . and colour-wise what does everybody think ? it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , . you just roll . i'm all for them actually , they're quite very quick to to use . so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design ? and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? like if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small . we really gotta wrap up so . it's small , and that we've got like the the slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that isn't that what we just said said we just have to decide now ? we can do that , . let's let's try and get the slogan on there , and .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the detailed design phase will be doing product evaluation and so will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ?
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . so presumably that might be an idea to put into . but but to sell it for twenty five you need lot of neat features .
i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the detailed design phase will be doing product evaluation and so will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .
so we come again for the the second meeting . for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one . and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we have got new project requirement .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . so we're just estimating that it would be less . how about these ? are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ? so we're quite far over . now we're gonna something's gonna have to go . we're at sixteen point eight and something has to go to the tune of two point three euro , so let me see , what are we yes , four point three . how how are we going to achieve this high-end product if we only have very sparse two point three ?
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , .
so we come again for the the second meeting . for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one . and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we have got new project requirement . so teletext becomes outdated . so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . and we should have our image in the in the design . so , let's start with the the industrial designer . so have powerpoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so you can reach it from here . or you can use the whiteboard if you want . just go to explorer . one is communication . to the in . and , that's it . we should use f_p_g_a_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to it's field programmable something array . what is f_p_g_a_ ? it's field programmable gateway arrays . alright and that's it for the working design . so if you have any questions ? and how about the battery power ? you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? no no no no , we have to to have embedded batteries in in the into the . into the more compact and , .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . so let this wonderful thing . so we can go to the slides . which is can you show it to the the camera . so final design .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . then we will evaluate the product . and end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . so let's start with the cost aspect so so look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have standard battery , to have yellow banana shaped case with rubber material around it to be to feel spongy , and also at the different aspect like having wheel etcetera . and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros . so which is good , because we had price gap of twelve point five euros . participant four , yes . so you can go . we can go through . so made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about during the previous meetings . so you can go through and so we have six points . we we talked about before . and after we ha we have an an average , and we see . so fancy look and feel , what do you think ? you can presen . between one and seven . so it's very very . give it give it five .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . shall we go in the order that you just did it ? how do hook my screen up ? you might have to disconnect rose . there's wee wee plug just just that one there that's it , . where does it go ? i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ? it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ?
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ?
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . that would be me . function eight it . there we go .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . do you have any preference of order ?
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . three presentations , you can go in any order you choose . shall we go in the order that you just did it ? how do hook my screen up ? you might have to disconnect rose . it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever .
there we go . hopefully that's us ready to to go . functional design meeting . we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , your colour and slogan is down at the bottom there . just to say quickly would have thought that only being used for television the macro facility may now not be required . or at its functionality would have been of limited use .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ?
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ?
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ? so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s . it's the same things as presented before . but here we have we have four buttons for navigation . press one button acting as enter button . so according to what you said it's more robust to the user . and it's also cheaper to produce . we can produce such remote control for about four dollars .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , , take it away poppy . do need to plugged in .
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? no , no , you you can start . so start , . so from our market research we've come to the conclusion that fancy look and feel , as opposed to functional look and feel , is our number one priority . fancy is is is is the , , highest priority . secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . so this is number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the is is important as , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . from our fashion people in paris and milan , we've discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? i'm gonna we'll look at that in second . most people use only very slim portion of all the controls . so what we're looking at here is people want this technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . so what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different inspirations , , one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . they get lost lot , as it came up in our last meeting . takes time to learn how to use them .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ?
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ?
we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . we introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ bit more , mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as . it's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .
it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
except the entire screen . it's the whole screen . you can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , it's like . so it's like separate channel from like what you're watching ? but it's becoming out-dated now , because of the internet . nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so those are our new product requirements .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . the simple one being better for user , the complex better for an engineer . and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be user-oriented remote , something simple . and that we didn't wanna go with universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity . we would just have t_v_ remote . and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . have it be something that looks different .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ?
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . don't really have favourite animal , but have one in mind , so i'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty the corner of white board . you have one in mind ? the spider has spider lives in web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions . unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of of web . and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? we all have presentation again , so if we go through those and then . three presentation , . so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . then there is chip and still the sender . so yes including the power supply as . i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , . any of you think of like the the old torches which you wind up . there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more . so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? or are we going for the regular ? but is there any other , that's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , before we make decision . but but the way that interpret that it doesn't seem to send out signal to the telly , it just it's like parrot just rep reply replying to your message .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . and then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . and did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be single or double ? i'd say single . single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute double . it's only actually the size of my hand . then that's covered . and so we everybody have that ? she's got it . so , we're using the criteria for seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . it falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? are we going to indi say we individually rate what do you say ? good job , team . how did you get that in there ? the slightly resembling giant delicious cookie . it it does . that was good . alright , let's go back to this no , that's it . we're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those . it is single-curved , so one of those . down here , case material . and special colour . and special colour . down here , interface type . we're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . less than twenty nine even . and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no . they're special colour . they're they're special form , 'cause they're indented . and , they're special material . we're under cost then . no , we're under . twelve point five is our limit . we've got eleven point two . so we can go to production .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , your colour and slogan is down at the bottom there . just to say quickly would have thought that only being used for television the macro facility may now not be required . or at its functionality would have been of limited use . so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so . and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . so i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . sh would you like to i'll just do it from here .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera . it is possible . you put it on . it was somewhere in something like this . don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami . what do you have in short cut ? you have no over .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ?
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . if we're talking about the area just . we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . so what else ? there's plastic for that area around the button . and then rubber would be the squishy like thing ? and lots of special colours actually . one point three is . so it's one was true and seven was false ? so you really didn't like it ? it was the other way round . it was the other way round too . so we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way gosh . 'cause we've all we all our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . end of meeting . you have to tell her , she we have to fill in all this . so that's all for today . it would be good idea , like it . it's hard enough to get people actually paying attention .
it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control . and then we're gonna close up the meeting . and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . first want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .
we we designed the two items . yes but we yes , we should phone him . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . , this is actu this could be genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . but , i've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause the scroll wheel is fairly key part of , , everyone has has that it's that it could be quite useful thing , so . stable thing , . to have , , . but it's important , , to have two scroll wheels because , , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume it's , it's very handy for it to have instant feedback and response , so . but , i've also included this turbo button because , , every design should have turbo button , and so this is , unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the the tuner on the t_v_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so , the the person might want to have might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , , displays that station .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? the one this is somewhat oblique reference to my have three three year old daughter who who who who is affectionately known as miss monkey . monkeys have attitude . which is good thing . and fr and from from the point of view of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . so like monkeys . and and thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . it occurs to me there might be niche for for remote that aimed towards some of that functionality but using just conventional push button design . and therefore putting it into much lower price bracket . , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for touch screen would probably be possibly out of our . but you think again something to control multiple units in simple fashion . wouldn't like to say you you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could operate between multiple units in more integrated fashion . some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ?
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . my name's poppy . hi , i'm genevieve . i'm the marketing expert . i'm an expert at marketing . i'll be telling you about the user requirement specifications for our new product . i'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . alright i'm heather and i've said i'm your project manager , you can read what it is that i'm doing .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . you can add your buttons . it's in option . so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off . then you ha you'll have volume control . so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . so say already , whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be lot of redundancy in the in the the issues and the the the things . like overlap between what you said ? for all that that'll happen . which is ma not necessarily bad thing , but may what i've already started doing is cr created slide in in my presentation here so so that we think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly have hard time separating separating things completely . what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts lot on what like market research that that i've been so how do how do get this up ? hard to where your role ends , . you wanna here we go . there we go . there you go . just before bring this up what i'll just say is what i've what i've done is tried to collect some information so that then relay this to to you so that it's now becomes collective thing . and then lead us in the direction of deciding , what what are our options , what should we decide and do what , so . increase that 'cause we can't see the that's much better . can you , . so does that make sense ? so what got is looked into some information and tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what decisions we could take away from it and then by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . so i'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and , what they want and what are issues with with existing products . to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . and then , as say we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and dunno . bouncing on top . so this is what i've found here , lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . so they find them ugly . most people find them ugly . the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . i'm gonna we'll look at that in second . most people use only very slim portion of all the controls . so what we're looking at here is people want this technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . so what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different inspirations , , one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . they get lost lot , as it came up in our last meeting . takes time to learn how to use them . this is why mention when craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so it doesn't just look like big panel , kinda like when you you look at , , new computer keyboard , that is quite explanatory . if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . and will admit what r_s_i_ stands for . repetitive strain injury . is installing new remote control something that people , it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . no , that did not come up . so here here is another review here of the main things . also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . so if that's possible we might consider getting into it . and here as we move thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . people additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the the techie features how we can put that into unit which is which people like . they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . so want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . so just looking at what what craig craig's ideas are sorta tell me that what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this . so if we do say want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . it's like like find lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about is if you wanna just turn on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . so it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , . that's it's good idea . that's that's the but i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say , how do we collectively move on with it . haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . but not let that confine us technologically . any comments on all of that ? one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our our target audience , our target market . so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? who wou who would have the money to spend . where's the money , . if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , don't i'm not really how much that will retail at . and who watches t_v_ . but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . so , who do you think we're aiming this at ? 'cause twenty five euros for remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , . is that too is that lot of money to buy an extra remote or replacement remote ? so not the high end range , but middle , middle up-ish . you pay , what , ten ten quid for remote ? like simple replacement , . this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is table of what people would pay more for certain feature . just gives us rough idea of where the the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is . mostly focused around the twenty five age group . so do you think we're we're aiming at fairly young market then ? young professional , . , it's the . did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ? what what do you think , craig ? the the older group . it does it does fit with the market that we're identifying , in terms of . we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause , there needs to be some selling point to it . so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like really high response to that . so we could say that was our target . twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as group as because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . they have bit of expendable income to spend on this thing . perhaps that age group is significant as because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . people who are about wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on computer or mobile phone like that . so these are people who are gadgety , ? people who are growing up used to , in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would regular . so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . that that's that's good point . so so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition if we can . if we can . one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition now , because , based on what you've go everybody's saying , , you want something simple . why is that ? you want basic and you want something that's easy to use . speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . could it be an on off thing ? but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into particular technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . like if you want it on . where you can activate it and deactivate it ? so we should suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's it's something that can be used to fulfil function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . do you wanna give us your presentation and then then we can might have been good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're , exactly , . it's good t's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . it's something that's just occurred to me as if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people with physical disability as . and not losing . and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , they they're saying it's lose it in the couch . like we're what we're getting in into here is mating different design features together that they . reckon one problem with speech recognition is i've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . really , you've seen one before . do you think we need like further advances in that area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? it'd probably quite expensive to put in . do you mind passing me my notepad . there you go .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more . and then there's solar cells . as final option . for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just to say all all these are supplied by real reaction . so for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which is just the same as the standard ones .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , , take it away poppy . do need to plugged in . it's , it's plugged in . so , no problem .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user friendly . the important points we have to talk about are it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . and for that we're going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . so let's try the whiteboard . so any of you who want to go .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ?
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . with the wheel it's easy . how man don't understand it . then you can you you have like little number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can and this is the the infrared port . can you repeat it ? so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . and you can tele , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so six is so it's good evaluation , . so will become eight soon ? it's very promising . t's bit biased . we have good price and . so this prototype is quite .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . and if we want something fancier , the kinetic provision of energy could be , but if it's worth the cost . so we've got to discuss that . for the case of the remotes itself , they can be general case , which is just flat one . you can have curved one or double curved one , if what , so , more ergonomic , that suits the palm of your hand , that thing . what's double curved one ? so then the case material itself , so it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium .
just need to know so write it down . that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything . so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as ? we need an . and that's because of cost restraints is it ? what about the electronics here ? we need an advanced chip , . single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing . so we want double-curved ? is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ? we're gonna have to skip the rubber . so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ? for the case itself , one colour . we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons . no can do . we could just go with . normal coloured buttons . do you want colour differentiation here ? no that's not the button we're talking about . so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . ach that's shame . so take away that completely ? and now we're under budget . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . doesn't say so . but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . no , , . dunno do you it means it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so . on dif answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then then we're told use the co company company colours . reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier . did did you get the email sent you ? not just yet . got the email . was wondering if that got there .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control . and then we're gonna close up the meeting . and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . first want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . let's go ahead and , back , previous . so what wanna do now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . who would like to start us off ? don't mind going first . do you have powerpoint or no ? it's not gonna be multi-functional . and we need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . we're trying to get our name out there in the world . and what teletext is ? in states we don't have it , but it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , sports , it's very bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even , just black with just text . what is it ?
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just little bit for ju just thought . you could simply have slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out bit more is on one side or the other . but as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the l_ the is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design . now got your note about keeping the cost down .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . and here the the switch that control if you want it's the but . why you why you you put it in the the side ? it's not good place . no it's the all around camer microphone isn't it . the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only single mic or microphone array ? that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen with just four buttons . and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or vegetable , or whatever they like . so it should be much more customised to make different shapes . and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . but the the problem is that is it robust to mishandling ? we have you should find material that is robust at the same time spongy .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway . it should work like this . so will try to get my presentation running . can't help you with that . it's no matter . then press al this . so , good morning , everyone . welcome at at the kick off meeting of our latest project . hope you all have been updated about it . so we will try to structure this meeting with an with an agenda as presented here . after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . see what our roles are in this project .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line . let's see , minutes from the last meeting . we looked at the the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . and spongy feel .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . can have the laptop over here , or ? you have to come here .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting .
so we come again for the the second meeting . for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one . and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we have got new project requirement . so teletext becomes outdated . so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time . you're participant four . i'm participant four believe . and now full screen . there we go . for children , exactly . like an animal or . like doll , or yes . that's what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with remote control , . so , figured , just put all together . you got caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and as for the user interface problem , , too many buttons . give it one button and and it's , for the the cowboy in all of us i'm not quite what the the function is there but it's you could have . like that design . is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? 'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . alright , so sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . that was more of gimmick . do you think ? it makes it fairly unnecessary then . so scratch that .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in minute after take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . as we remember , opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ?
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . if you dump it in there . what's your username ? what's your username and password ? there we go . hopefully that's us ready to to go . functional design meeting . we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users . with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ?
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . i'm i'm i'm not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of already on the market that we can modify . but that that's that's your area of expertise . and then the , , the the overall design of the case is is is kendra's field and we we had some discussions last time as as to how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those da today . and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we go for voice , buttons , or or bit of both . and then , , for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the the look , feel and design , kendra the ho how the the user actually uses it and and andrew the the product evaluation . and kate and kendra will be producing model for us to to look at .
no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . it's thinking about it . it'll get there . so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices . findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual . there're some special ones available , like this one here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that we need to watch out for is v_ in volume because people some bring little picture of what ours could look like . so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is slide button , like you have on mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ?
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it . then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this . bra that's that's like it .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . this is first concept of our controller . the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so so the the user the the user interface should be very very cute , very very attractive . with this advanced features we we can attract lot of user . there this is the three concepts of our controller . have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap to zap between channels . so some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . do you think they will be able to use gestures ? because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , they will get injuries because of that ? if you cannot find your controller , you can just just just speak something such as , , one two . that's good that's good point , so . but suppose you got cold . you have mute remote controller . so you can use your gesture . that's no problem . do you we're far from television it will work ? no no no it's not that's that's not problem because you you don't have to wear microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . but where is the controller ? where is the controller ? it's in your family , in your home . no , but then it's it's like this .
so , success on the whiteboard . there you go . you can harness the awesome power little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s and things we like about the city , we'll so moving on to not fun project finance . what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but , i'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty that's like forty bucks for remote . it would have to like do my laundry for me .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . and that's you must have very long shirts . that's way far down lapel mic . wha , , alright . lapel lapel lapel . that's almost crotch mi cr dear dear . that's it's down , it's quite close .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it . then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this . bra that's that's like it . you knocked it up ? and we're gonna evaluate the product and close . got forty minutes to do this in .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , . on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . this is the power key , it's kinda like the biggest so how to turn on . that's the little menu key . this is the infra-red section so you it'll be sending rays and if you're pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . , good , good . we got microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can talk to it like that and it'll still understand . showing me age , what ipod covers are like . didn't know that but they're it's just rubbery and that way spongy like is something that people wanted and it just stretches over and that way probably helps protect it little bit too as and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ . but it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine . li that'll be the covers as , . tha it's it's detailed point , wondered how will people put these down wonder ? 's little longer . so good that's that that's excellent . let us what's on the next one ? yes , let's have look at the finance . now we're given clear design brief , if get the spreadsheet up . the the maximise button .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . so you're participant two ? no no no . no you're no , i'm participant one . you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , suppose . but but this is . but if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . you you have some international standards , where , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . you mean for the pic pictograms or things like that ? here , escape , , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , that it should be the same .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . are we gonna hav hav an are we have we decided on whether we're gonna supplement it with anything , , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go we're . don't have any other questions on this . let's move over to , . the fact also that we are having rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . 'cause so if we wanna have lock of some sort it would have to be button . but that should be , speak with the button department , but that it should be easy to have button that just prevents prevents the other the other buttons from operating .
and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . so i'll be putting the minutes of this this meeting into the project documents folder . so just to just to confirm that we we're doing in the next the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our industrial designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . and you'll all get specific instructions as . so , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . made three different prototypes and we'll start with with this one . we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . it's you hold it either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there's whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . we have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . and am hemant , the industrial designer . for being here . so let's have look to the the agenda . so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . so , the goal of this project is to developed new remote control . it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . as usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company . it is in three step as . first the functional design .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . yes but we yes , we should phone him . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents . it's he said to me when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . there is no no negotiation possible in this matter . so people are used to that shape , . don't take care too much about the colour because we don't take . now we are supposed to give some oper offers now . so here would be the the the infrared led l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , the on-off button , in red . here would be the volume . on the on the left , , so easy to turn on and off . and so this is very cheap version so there are you can carry on matthew . also so you have browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , , if you have video you can forward , back . how can you change from v_c_r_ to t_v_ , by the way ? no no no , this is single this this is model with just the t_v_ one . no no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that . so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . can you get the batteries ? no no the battery has fallen down , that's . battery's low , isn't it the ink ? the that's the that that one ? no no it's not that , it's how to close battery . now it should be . you got second ? won't be able to tell . yes , it it has . is that working ? did it come out ? because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . let's go ahead and , back , previous . so what wanna do now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . who would like to start us off ? don't mind going first . do you have powerpoint or no ?
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ?
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so this is just introductions . my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . forgot to say i'm the project manager but figured you all knew that already , so . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so here's our agenda for today . we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? suppose draw an animal , . uh-oh there goes the ten . they sleep all day , they're easy to draw . do you wanna anything ? if the the . had the cat as , but i've got spare one . the pen is running out of two million . so i'll use the spare one . but it's harder to draw . and the other thing is not needs to be . do you needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? like hand hand held size , . don't think you need but definitely not . not not huge , but . it can't be that hard to put some noise on it .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? raring to go ? blue one eight . should do it , good one . me again , rajan the marketing expert . as we have decided in the last meeting that have to find out , , . hold on , . and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at time .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . you can add your buttons . it's in option . so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off . then you ha you'll have volume control . so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do . so it's actually scale . one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven . and one is one , . if it's somewhere in between you put four .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does . are we ready to start ? it's now quarter of four . this is another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to sarah present the evaluation criteria . we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and you're all thinking of , my , because we're only given forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get bigger market share and bigger audience .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . and that's all had to say for that . so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ? are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna , we should see yours first . i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . i've been looking at some trends in in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the the one that's the one talked about last time , that we'd asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we've also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . it's kinda like peacock . it kinda was actually , 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and i'm like , this is the middle of scotland in like march . so that was pretty . and it landed by wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . wish i'd had my camera . so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long . and we will once again have poppy as our first presenter .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert . i'm craig and i'm user interface . so we're designing new remote control and have to record who's here actually . so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ? and you all arrived on time . so des design new remote control . as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . so that's our our brief , as it were . and so there are three different stages to the design . i'm not really what what you have already received in your emails . what did you get ? that's that's it . is that what everybody got ? did you get the same thing ? so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . so you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . so who would like to go first ? so this one here , ? my favourite animal is like beagle . charac favourite characteristics of it ? , high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take lot of physical affection from their family . and , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health . so this is blue . my family's beagle . my favourite animal would be monkey . then they're small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , i'm gonna be up there with them . there's too much gear . you can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . tail's bit big , . was gonna choose dog as . but i'll just draw different dog . my favourite animal is my own dog at home . that doesn't really look like him , actually . he looks more like pig , actually . what kind is it ? he's mixture of various things . and what do like about him , that's just to suggest that his tail wags . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very affectionate and and he's quite quite wee as so he can doesn't take up too much space . and and he does funny thing where he chases his tail as , which is quite amusing , so it is . is he aware that it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long . and we will once again have poppy as our first presenter .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer . you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . and and when they're tired they're quite cute as , so . that's why like dogs . 've not actually had too many pets over my time 'cause to be honest with you i'm not too keen on them anyway . not to worry . so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? push the screw . alright i've never attached to anything . it's taking it little bit there you go . alright , so , if you are able to get access to the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is . but , don't even know how to play this . press the little presentation . 's move on to the next presentation on effects . was that you ? have unscrewed it ? user interface , . here we go . and that's in the shared , if did it , if anyone wants to look at it . it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ?
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for . let's see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what . i'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation . which is fairly significant number would say . and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get remote that would look fancy . so that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be modern look , that's definitely important . they say that current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of users said they zap lot . and if anyone could clarify what that means ? and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . and there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . and some of them it looks like barely need to be included . channel selection is used the most frequently . and then teletext was the next . volume and then power . the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so tracking device of some sort would be good idea . they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote . and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i_ . repetitive strain injury . what is it ? just repetitive strain injury . and so bas . as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they're all for it .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features . so now we will have three presentations . so will will will this with including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be lower than twelve euros to produce ? you received something . also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? but that's all . you we an email from the manufacturing division that they have voice recognition chip already developed . it says that ri now they just use it to to record answers to particular questions . but it could be it's possible . and could it be adapted ? instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like command .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , , take it away poppy .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this . we haven't decided on an order . no , any any order's fine . how do put this i'll just put the cable in . just you may need to but sometimes you have to do it it's like three set setting cycle , so press it couple times , hold down function and then press eight . is that it ? can you see ? it sh it takes few seconds . is it in the thing ? you need to help me . and then press function . could you just plug it back into hers because she had . that's is that it ?
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ? is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ? yes , so . i'll do that next time . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ?
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . so let this wonderful thing . so we can go to the slides .
or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one . know my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . so for them it was just how many devices control . so , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses so . so do you think that should be like main design aim of our remote control , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , . or even like , , notes about what you wanna watch . like you might put in there want to watch such and such and look that's good idea . so extra functionalities . like , personally for me , at home i've i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them . and and that's the end of the meeting . so got that little message lot sooner than would , so . before we wrap up , just to make we're all on the same page here , , do we we were given an example of coffee machine , ? are we at ma now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ? just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control .
you ready back there ? this is the kick-off meeting for the day . we're the new group to create new remote control for real reaction . as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have little training on tools , create plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . we've got teletext outdated . did you get any information on that ? so got that in email form . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight . just this little bit is that that's still video remote part , so we could get rid of that as . and don't really think that you need nine numbers . the on the for for general television purposes you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for future such channels . how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . like how often do you hit nine ? that's just for video , so we wouldn't need any of that . so we could get it down to what ? so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve we got fourteen that we need . which isn't really too many . that'll be quite easy to make user guide for fourteen button remote .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? so i'm thinking we should design remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . what do you think , ? this is , like cat , , soft . textile tactile , tactile remote control . although i'll just put there . you're dragging you have tail .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian .
ready to go ? so we've got our conceptual design meeting . i'm old as . hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . thirty's really young , ? so here's our agenda our agenda .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . hope that clicks in , i'll just i'll hold it on , . dear , what happened there ? hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . again this is off the top of my head , was gonna do big cat too , . dear , it doesn't look what like what want it to be .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ? because have here just one . so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as . anything i've missed ? so if you want to present your prototype go ahead . this is it ? ninja homer , made in japan . there are few changes we've made . look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and inside , so instead we've this is gonna be an screen , just very very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and confirm button . apart from that , it's just the same as we discussed last time . and there isn't it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? so the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use . where are they ? they're in the panel and the jog-dial ? 'cause the panel just displays functionally what you're doing . so what thing is gonna be . if you're using an advanced function , like brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say it's like it only has four columns , it's very simple like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . it might even be one , bit more complex panel with pictures like the sun or the , , the the symbols of the various functions . and what is this here ? that's number pad . so the number pad is , . where are we gonna have the slogan ? they're al along this . just like inside there . you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as , or at the bottom . 'cause slogans are usually quite small , , they're not like huge so they're say button's about say button's about this size , , so you would still have plenty of space for slogan , say even for that . plus half five six seven eight , about nine total . about nine in total . six , seven , eight , nine , ten . so we're talking about ten centimetres . that sounds good . that would be good . that's and it's very bright as . is it possible i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? 'm we're gonna have again the the the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . but this button , because it's red it's very prominent , we're gonna use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for two seconds it'll send stand-by signal . so just could you just list all the things that it does so write them in the report . apart from that it's gonna be used as confirm button for the screen and you use this as jog-dial . so that's like an button , . we've discussed how high it is , but how wide is it ? how high is it ? no as in the height , but what about the width ? don't think five is be about three and half . something by there . is this to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there . so you can power on and off , what else can you do ? three and half . you can skip straight to channel using these buttons . were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . jog-dial for volume . and what else do you do with the jog-dial ? you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and . contrast , brightness , , and anything else ? just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ? are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ? probably colour or sharpness . colour , sharpness . lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . what about sound settings ? can you change any of those ? audio , we have like your basic your base , your mid-range , your high range . the the balance . left-right balance , even pre-programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting . that's could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? was that an option ? it'll be cost prohibitive , . we've only got like what , ten cents left so . it would cost more than plastic . logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . there we go . hopefully that's us ready to to go . functional design meeting . we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , your colour and slogan is down at the bottom there . just to say quickly would have thought that only being used for television the macro facility may now not be required . or at its functionality would have been of limited use .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . we looked at the the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . and spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so this is just introductions . my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . forgot to say i'm the project manager but figured you all knew that already , so . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . we've got teletext outdated . did you get any information on that ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . she's gonna figure out what what the consumer wants . ryan is our user interface designer . and manuel is the industrial designer . so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan , and you're gonna pick apart . we decided our remote , we want it to be universal remote that everyone would want . we want to be modern , fun , different . to go to the next one ? you click on that guy . this is my report , which is going to be based on survey that was sent . gosh , i've no idea . just press the arrow keys . usually goes to it .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera . you have powerpoint ? should be in my in their folder no ? who are you ? and we have technical problem . do we think in the in the wrong folder ? it is possible . you put it on . it was somewhere in something like this . there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ? if you remember but that's . what we want here is remote control . so the question first of all what to control . so most people want to have remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and like that . so there's project called x_ house like that that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers . so there is one that is one thing . the other is the the finder feature by whistling or whatever . if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want . so it should be package in that case . so the user interface will consist of two parts .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and so think of this concept . to research it i've had look on the the homepage again . it's provided me with more examples of previously existing remote controls . there's wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so i've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this so then this we're looking for suggestions on size size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . what found from the research is that most the current controls are just big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're hold like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . the the controls themselves tend to use very inconsistent colour scheme .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . and then the buttons are actually poking through rather than on top . and the buttons will be much lighter blue , almost see-through . it's just very pale blue and light-up yellow . the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . and then at the bottom we have our logo . bright yellow design with the r_r_ which will actually look like our logo . like no , it's very fashionable . me too , very chic . thi would give it one . one , give it one . i'll give it two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . that's that's just like that's clay , it's prototype . what do you say ? i'd say two . alright , average is two . is it technologically innovative ? i'm taking over your job here . no , it's fine , you're you're project manager .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall in line . let's see , minutes from the last meeting . we looked at the the trends . we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . and spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . then we looked at the the method for coming up with our own remote . looking at other other devices . but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . and the the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . would you like to done . with the scroll and the . luckily we are going to find out . or not luckily . do you have marketing presentation for us . you are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that found . just based on the past trend reports that was looking at earlier . and then we'll do group evaluation of the prototype . and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . with seven being false , we did not achieve that . so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? it's definitely different than anything else out there . so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes would say , would say most definitely . it's it's curved .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . so you're participant two ? no no no . no you're no , i'm participant one . you you have some international standards , where , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . you mean for the pic pictograms or things like that ? here , escape , , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , that it should be the same . it should , . so you have to the sh the user there the power off button it is something very international , that so . the user should know .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ?
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ?
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . so presumably that might be an idea to put into . but but to sell it for twenty five you need lot of neat features . 'cause , what twenty five euros , that's about , fifteen pounds or so ? it's about that .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . but but the screen is very an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be that that's true . actually when you are watching the t_v_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , , you want to and this gives protection to the actually , giving cover to that actually . gives protection because when it falls down it it is it is is is it gives protec it's more robust that way . yes , more robust . and you have very good chances . it's low weight . and now it easy to use . easy to use . you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ? is that part of both of them or ? we can still discuss that . so , and together with evaluating this we we might come with new ideas adding things or removing of options because they are too expensive , but i've received framework which we can do this . looking like no but except for the design of the surf . the first one , not really muc . there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , ? the surf design . what what features are we actually including ? you should be rea no it's more of the feel .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ?
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , . on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push .
it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .
'cause moved it . 's put it over here . then we don't have to worry about it . ready for this ? alright , it is powerpoint time . i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun . so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , , will open them slowly , no ?
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . i'm not if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . there's problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control get with the the red colour button for stand-by and the other examples of that the buttons should be large . they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . they should be easy to press , very comfortable . one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have v_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be down volume button , that's kinda confusing . should avoid things like that . if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . do we have corporate colour scheme ? it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after . and the play-doh 's yellow . any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be hidden , they shouldn't be on the shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some special extra effort . if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , they got cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look . that's just wrong . and we got an email from it's the the research department , and they've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask it question . so it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take and possibility . aye that's good idea , . and these are problems i've had with it . where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . it's , fashion into electronics . and we how flexible the colour scheme is . you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say if we can use any other colours or that's it . lots of good information there .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ? so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . and no teletext .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get bigger market share and bigger audience . so method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . so in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device . so we've got tool training . try out whiteboard . so we will . so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . this is make the whiteboard works . so who wishes to go first . and this would be because they're very independent , they're very intelligent , compared to dogs . and they can be very very affectionate . some people don't but know very affectionate cats . and they can look after themselves . i'll i'll shall see if get across without just tangling everything . shall rub that out , actually ? and and when they're tired they're quite cute as , so . that's why like dogs . 've not actually had too many pets over my time 'cause to be honest with you i'm not too keen on them anyway . not to worry . so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw . as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as . so so we're looking for some we're looking for device that is robust and and therefore won't get damaged too easily . we're looking for device that is what was the other things you said there ? easy to use so the buttons are accessible . easy to use . is easy to use and see . is this just television remote ?
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ?
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway . it should work like this . so will try to get my presentation running . can't help you with that . it's no matter . then press al this . on this normal good . doesn't appear on the screen here . yes and you can put can clip it on your somewhere . so , good morning , everyone . welcome at at the kick off meeting of our latest project . hope you all have been updated about it . so we will try to structure this meeting with an with an agenda as presented here . after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . see what our roles are in this project . so , we have been provided with some technical tools to to communicate and to , learn from each other's plans as say so we will also try to to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me whether you worked with them before . then we will come to the to the to the actual project plan . you all hope how it's about the new remote control we are going going to design . then we will discuss , , how it should be and wh what what our new product should look lite like . and then after some twenty five minutes hope we can end this meeting . for us it's just like normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . so , but it's actually , not go with . no they will record through that . there's sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make . but for us it's just like normal whiteboard . you you doesn't it work ?
said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . do you have any preference of order ? i'd like to hear i'd like to hear who's who's on the from from catherine actually first . want what i'd like to hear about is if we've finally decided on what energy we're gonna be using and it's just that , let's let's hear from you first . she is still finishing her .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight . haven't as yet , no . but got got an email that said to make that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . so i'm guessing that notice on the bottom there it's got what's that ? a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour see in that is the red . would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the circular section , because that seems to be for video as . so we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . which one is it ? interface concepts , no ? interface concepts new . either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there . mine will always read copy of something or other . copied mine before sent it over .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? raring to go ? blue one eight . should do it , good one . me again , rajan the marketing expert . as we have decided in the last meeting that have to find out , , . hold on , . and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at time . 'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . alright , so sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . that was more of gimmick . do you think ? it makes it fairly unnecessary then . so scratch that .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy .
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones .
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? no , no , you you can start . because if it's too small we can we can lose it , at home , . what user wants . he wants small remote control , or ? small control that they can hold in hand . with big buttons . that it it should fit in the hand .
didn't get any pictures . it's single curved . it's single curved . t's not the . it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important . that is important .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's he's been doing . it's so , let's go . first with rama . so we're to mainly design mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . and as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . so , can we highlight the specific features of our , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . you're , you have to so you say do we agree on that ? we have to . so , do you think . so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations . we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user friendly . the important points we have to talk about are it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . and for that we're going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . so let's try the whiteboard . you do this ? usually just change channels . because i'm only using three or four channels but and then back to the one was before , so there's whichever it was . but they keep generally their slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put , you can only have one bit . change channel like this , want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , . also we can be here , that would be .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there . and then we're gonna evaluate it .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . then believe each of you have presentation . i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . and then we'll have the closing . which we'll have forty minutes for . and we want to be different . and then we went over couple of different ideas . the keyboard shape . we decided that it should probably be one-handed . something we could use with one hand . and that was our last meeting .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , . so it's the functional design stage is next , . and and that's the end of the meeting .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? 'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . alright , so sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . that was more of gimmick . do you think ? it makes it fairly unnecessary then . so scratch that .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? shall go first again ? so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ?
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , , the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's very important fact , 'cause if they say , , go home and think about it , that won't work . also mentioned was it should be it should have very short learning curve . and it could be sold by using slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and display clock so that people could you could see the time , , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and some holder for the for the item . francino who is our interface designer has mentioned that the that it , , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have channel lock . particularly with small children that they couldn't watch channel that is undesirable . it should be compact .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting .
it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ?
and then we're gonna close up the meeting . and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . first want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of i'll just give you minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users . with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before . people thought their remotes were ugly , that remotes zap lot . they only use finite amount of buttons . and that they often lose the it's easy to lose remote . which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . so the way to go is if you want scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an screen , and then you can choose either plastic or titanium . or wood even . if you wanna make it particular shape , use plastic . add an screen , add scroll wheel , that'll be fine . or make it just push-buttons . plastic gives you the biggest variety of of options .
the i_d_ is going to do the look and feel design , the u_i_d_ the user interface design . you're going to get lot of , , the final say on what buttons get put we'll all talk about it , but , that's what you're gonna do , ? and you're gonna do some product evaluation . and now , the i_d_ and u_i_d_ , you two are going to work together on prototype using modelling clay . and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . for very productive meeting .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does . does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? we came up together , we're good . are we ready to start ? it's now quarter of four . this is another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to sarah present the evaluation criteria . we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . looking like scroll , but it's really push button technology , excuse my spelling that was actually in use , that is behind the scenes is push button which we according to kate have very good grasp on doing that in production . we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be separate product that could be suggested to management . and as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo , slogan and image might be good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . we did have few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? curvature , is it to your liking ? see , the on-off's in the back . yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . and then you can use your thumb . so we say true . we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . so we'll say we'll say false . easy to use . one , is that inappropriate ? trendy , and say specifically spongy fruity .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point .
i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ?
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . it would that would mean you'd need television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ? bluetooth would , , enable you , , to connect you if you get call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs , you would get on your television you're being called by this person now . that would mean we'd have to make television as . things like that . no , that would be your telephone in with your television . the that wouldn't be the remote so much , .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . so , everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here . so , , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , , the thumb button is the power button . what's the big blue thing ? that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button . and then it also has digit for muting the and then then you can also there's numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we t's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . that certainly does . so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them . something that the whiteboard thingy , that's . but pen with camera on it , don't t's such new thing . it's or in such new idea . it would be different if it was hand writing recognition , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on computer screen as picture file rather than actual text . they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . we should end this , since we're off off topic .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ?
and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , , take it away poppy . do need to plugged in .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert . you can you are . but why not ? and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they how to they to use properly their remote controls . and they are bad for r_s_i_ but don't remember what is r_s_i_ . so they are bad . tha that's look .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . clunky in what sense , like heavier ? it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size . see , so it's more just basic . got very few buttons on it and , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about . so just stick to to regular . so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . do you wanna recap on that , craig ? we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic possible . on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to channel . and is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness . another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? is it is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , , they get ours and it's doesn't have that . it's as optional functions . if that'd be problem . could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be device . this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from manufacturer's point of view , from person designing the device , but from point of view of person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like so what we could have is like three buckets , , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . it might help with the visualisation . and it would actually help with the component build as . because the on off also goes , , like on off like power , not on off sound . not on off video . although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's mute button , , so you you have you have choice of putting it on to others or device . device is anything which we can't categorise , . so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi . we put it out . anything to do with what you hear , . you you put that into audio . and then visual , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , like that . and then video is anything that you can see . and then suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are bit more . like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ?
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . and , , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing . the meeting will be forty minutes long .
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? no , no , you you can start . so start , . can you open my presentation , . i'm number four . can you pass the mouse , . so want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and follow follow , that's that's no task for me , but seven to seven at least , but , . so we have lot we have to take decision today , so we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . first energy it's key problem because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , , like that . because can we have and speech recognition with battery , and it's also related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? not just point to the energy things . if we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's for l_ speech recognition and , so no problem in energy , .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ?
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . if everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . my name's poppy . i'm the industrial designer for this project . i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product .
for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . so did you manage yes see him , good yes . it should've gone through to you . yes have it . so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . can put this on ? so we have to work out way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , .
soon as get this . this is our last meeting . i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . and then we'll have , the prototype presentation . then we will do an evaluation . or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again .
no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design . you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? the u_i_ guy also work on that , , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs . alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . but first would like quickly to to decide of to give name to the project .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ? yes , so . i'll do that next time . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea . so , and gabriel . i'm catherine with c_ . c_a_t_h_ e_r_ i_n_e_ . e_l_ is it ? so that's gonna be you catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . just connecting this . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing . i'm gonna draw it on the board then . it's in blue , and couldn't change it . so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . so there you go , . so the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want voice activated one . and neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want voice act speech recognition in remote . but do the younger generation have the money ? no would would say the older the older people , .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager .
so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ? then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . and we've got forty minutes to do that in . so would say ?
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have bit of you can see it , . so decided i'd have look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that wasn't really my area because i'm dealing with the inside really . so , ran out of time so couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . and found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i'm i'm not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple batteries but those can be quite bulky so didn't you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control . could interject to ask question there , is that appropriate ? you're saying the triple batteries are small or the surrounding it ? no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in . the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , ? the the you can you can get the circular round ones but i'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . and which leads onto the next point about being small and easy to carry round . so you can see how the the yes no varies across the age group there , and substantial number of in the older age group , that's just general fear of new technology . bu we do have budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so when we can take cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , on the t_v_ you could put like pack on the t_v_ so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v_ and it beeps and you're like it's over there , something like that , but that's that sounds lot cheaper to me . but on on that again thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off loud noise to let where it is so that could be quite . that's super idea . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? from previous researches i've carried out on other projects , we've learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have shape memory . so they can be heated and and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal . so , , screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart . so , all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and that would be very important for products now . especially 'cause there's much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with like new designs .
's move on to the next presentation on effects . was that you ? have unscrewed it ? user interface , . here we go . and that's in the shared , if did it , if anyone wants to look at it .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . so again , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we'll we'll make final final decision . and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether it is practical to use long lasting one . and our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . and it it'll be , , prominently displayed as part of the the advertising literature that it's , , for life , guaranteed for life . there we go . i'll just be talking about the components design . and , looked at what exactly do remotes do . they for you to press key or give voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the t_v_ . the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with resistor and capacitor . what happens is you'll press number or give voice command and this creates connection within the the remote thows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces signal in morse code format . that's something we should think about . also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it . also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so was thinking perhaps combination of solar cells with back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . we also need to look at the chips , custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have upon . however that's gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to to convert , so if we were definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip . and that sums it up . so we we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change of one sort . was thinking just for the volume , but what what do you think ? just for the volume , . we could , . 'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , , . it's it's it , it it it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there's no no possibility of confusing the two .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . it could another type of repetitive stress injury though . but , no it's different movement so . and the feel of it , , we've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ material is often used in stress balls so this has got bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . bit of stress ball feel . would you like to feel it yourselves ?
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ?
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype . if you can see this , and the stars are showing that . and , society will accept that . and making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and ultimate smell of it . but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the the modern material we can select . and it's practical . and it's still say it's for our needs , so press something .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ?
so we come again for the the second meeting . for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one . and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we have got new project requirement . so teletext becomes outdated .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .
it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype .
i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it . now , what is not quite clear from their directive is whether they mean they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , , videos , d_v_d_s , satellite boxes , which we saw as being fundamental to the to the exercise . the the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . and on that basis we we need to bear that in mind , but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . the the logo being at the bottom of the screen there , the the the two r_s in grey against yellow background . now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the to the market . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and it might it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . but , since if we're marketing more fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it 'cause we're certainly could . we could , . we , we could even have it as like the buttons control this and the voice functions control the things that you would do all the time , so . so , if we could power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really and probably it would look better as .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ?
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ? is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ? yes , so . i'll do that next time . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . and we've got forty minutes to do that in . so would say ? the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . quickly jotted them down . so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . so the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . how however , our our remote control would only be dealing with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . so he he here is functional overview of the remote control . there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i'll basic go over to the . what's the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and screens in remote control . not that they actually gave me any answers on the screens , so should have taken that bit out , but anyway . what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . eighty percent of users would spend more to get , looking remote control . so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , but , it's up there . the remote control . so the the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ . this is pink because was copying and pasting the table , and didn't have time to white it out again . don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls . now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . we need both . what wh what was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that want to go onto channel number forty five . that would be another way to do it . but but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it and and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on remote control though ? so that you can yell at it , . , so you have to have the remote control . it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , . but then the remote control the idea is it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep near yourself . no , but was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , and not to yell at it from the distance . so wh another thing that can be used is that there can be beeper button on the t_v_ , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . that's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but you could have something , but if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v_ , some like two if you bought it in two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v_ . 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . the , but it solves the problem of having different noises . we're gonna have to wrap this up .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . if come back to the minutes of the last meetings . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on on the remote control because of costs . so we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . so hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ? so you are you saved your your presentation somewhere ? so you're four ? what you mean clothe no , missed that one . spongy means it it's like sp but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? didn't miss an didn't miss and saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . they're so they're not like dressed as carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , . no no , not not yet , not yet . so we're not gonna have remote control in the shape of of banana , just and so which fruit are you thinking of ?
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off . it fell that's why . it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick . kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it . so just to kick off the meeting so we're working now for real reaction , this is so it . just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . we're gonna just do quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we're gonna start talk little bit about tool training . essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . works for me . so that that we're we're making remote control which is thrilling but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model if you had time to check the in real life if you checked the the corporate website . we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary that nobody really thinks about and try to make it like john lewis or if you go to debenham's . so we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in user friendly slick sleek way . way we're gonna go about doing that is at first we're gonna start on the basics . and that's where i'm gonna need you the user interface designers and the the other designer that 't remember , the the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ the industrial designer on alright , getting into it to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're you are the bottom you're like no you can't do that you can't have x_ and y_ at the same time .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . my name's bob mor . and you are ?
good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . but if we use battery we will , . so it's point to discuss . then the case material we have also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . but t's not re real issue for the from the technical point of view . concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . and this is the last point , the choice of chips .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . so multi-coloured buttons . you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , . or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . makes it easy to use .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ .
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ? no , no , you you can start .
so we come again for the the second meeting . for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one . and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we have got new project requirement . so teletext becomes outdated . so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . and we should have our image in the in the design . so , let's start with the the industrial designer . so have powerpoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so you can reach it from here . or you can use the whiteboard if you want . just go to explorer .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . no the shift button's stuck in . so that would take away three , which would give us that's fine . should you can do one thing . so we're we should fire the accountants . eleven eleven euros sixty . we cou not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . so we could even add something . fire the accountants . we could add things . if you click back in that bottom cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys .
we're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those . it is single-curved , so one of those . down here , case material . and special colour . and special colour . down here , interface type . we're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ?
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow . or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting . we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off . it fell that's why . it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick . kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it . so just to kick off the meeting so we're working now for real reaction , this is so it . just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . we're gonna just do quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we're gonna start talk little bit about tool training . essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . we've got general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just bit of discussion close up . game in real life so want to i'm just gonna you got you can discuss that , i'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . so if you say something about marketing , , sorted , is exactly . so , success on the whiteboard . there you go . you can harness the awesome power little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s and things we like about the city , we'll so moving on to not fun project finance . what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but , i'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty that's like forty bucks for remote . it would have to like do my laundry for me . so what we can work on that later but we're gonna make lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . to integrate the fruit aspect , the the in really ? because mushroom was not in the trends . there was fruits . fruits and vegetables . but fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was mushroom ? mushroom is vegetable .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ? my name is eileen . my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . and as you already am betty . am the project manager for today . , using remote control . exp 'cause we we use we use , , everyday . and now having used remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or clearly better marked buttons , , things like that ? yes , feel the remote should be very compact . those which we get here nowadays it's very long .
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . i'm heather , i'm your project manager . so that was the opening . also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . to meet you poppy . my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer . will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . hi , i'm genevieve . i'm the marketing expert .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other . if we have to do it now , later later . so you can do it . so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros . twenty five euros ? it's quite good price , . it's it's reasonable , quite . it's reasonable , , . and it will be an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes . so , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your with the remote control . just be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy . it is the outside and the inside . but was thinking that he's user 'cause the user interface to design where the but button will be , . i'm the industrial designer . not the other one . so and the marketing expert will . i'm just go i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer . you have qwerty , azerty , french and u_k_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . and not too expensive . as we want to maximise the benefit . and easy to use . and you have to keep it under twelve euros and fifty , so . you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty euros . let's try to draw something . you forgot the chips . doesn't look so fine . have to be really careful . fish and chips . it's your turn .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ? are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as . and if we devote some energy into this , the recent productions of real reaction , the go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , we can also use this as platform to make it interact with other tools . and the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our designed tool . so again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . fifty percent of all these numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are lot of television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on remote control that looks fancy . could can ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've .
how do you wear this thing ? not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . just one thing . first it will be the functional design . third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . and then we will move to conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and like that . and then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point . so will now ask you which is very important for the design of new remote control for to each of us to to draw your favourite animal on the white board . it's an abstract drawing . it's and original . don't have red colour . usually orangutans have red hair so this is very important but don't have red pen , so yes . you want to draw something christine ? you have to imagine little bit .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ? and you all arrived on time . so des design new remote control . as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . so that's our our brief , as it were . and so there are three different stages to the design . that's that's it . is that what everybody got ? did you get the same thing ? so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . superb sketch , by the way . tail's bit big , . was gonna choose dog as . but i'll just draw different dog . my favourite animal is my own dog at home . that doesn't really look like him , actually . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and symbols . for remote control , do you think that will be suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . it does make sense from the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . so , possibly . and then and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . i'd say so , . , i've never bought remote control , so how how good remote control that would get you . but , suppose it has to look and gimmicky . let me just scoot on ahead here . does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue ? or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one . know my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . so for them it was just how many devices control . so , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses so . so do you think that should be like main design aim of our remote control , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . they're gone from being just like little scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda . so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , . or even like , , notes about what you wanna watch . like you might put in there want to watch such and such and look that's good idea . so extra functionalities . like , personally for me , at home i've i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them . you keep losing them . finding them is really pain , . it's usually quite small , or when you want it , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table . you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep . that's just really good id . there is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? actually had cable between it and the t_v_ and big like buttons that like , like on blender . and , , when about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still , , like massive junky thing on the table . still feels quite primitive . we could think about how , could be more , , streamlined . like touch screen ? something like that , . or whatever would be technologically reasonable . that's up to our industrial designer . 'cause it could it could it could be that it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having , these days there's pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , . or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ? just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , . one factor would be production cost . because there's cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price . that that's the maor .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . so if we want to go with that and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . really , the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and , you'd want like softer touch . address some of that issue , , with my presentation . but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , if we really want to go with that , because it is just trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just few months , because . people don't buy new remote every so often . that could just be spring thing now .
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . to integrate the fruit aspect , the the in really ? because mushroom was not in the trends . there was fruits . fruits and vegetables . but fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was mushroom ? mushroom is vegetable .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it . this one this is the user centred , it has quite few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . so , what remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . and so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours . and so , for my personal preferences , this one is easier to use and has quite , fewer buttons . we want something that sends messages easily to the television and was wondering about this example that they have . it looks narrow at the top , and was thinking if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ?
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about . so just stick to to regular . so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ?
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ?
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing . i'm gonna draw it on the board then . it's in blue , and couldn't change it .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ?
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . so you're participant two ? no no no . no you're no , i'm participant one . three three , it's three . did you save your presentation ? the rationale must be design , or so we can move to the next slide . so , baba is the the industrial designer . as you all know , my job is to design to give an industrial design of the remote control . so the re the remote control will be , , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like this one i'm holding in my hand and the t_v_ . so , this one is leather bu based but propose nifra infrared base , so so for me that it is better it's bet it's better to control t_v_ so , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to it's cheaper than laser , so . so you mean that infrared control is cheap technology ?
do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . that's the mute . it it'd probably have to be labelled mute . but , we didn't have anything small enough to write . they're thinking for the first time , was hard to get the the actual labelling on the individual buttons . we just chose simple shapes for all them . the important ones are the volume ones . an important consideration . so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the , . so we've got detail design meeting . so so , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but it would . but other than that , we got the red apple .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? just do it on the arrow . or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . if you dump it in there . what's your username ? what's your username and password ? we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . we introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ bit more , mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as . it's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . and then you could still have that available . an screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . it could be difficult in practice , . also , 'cause you would be looking down at the screen , than back up at your t_v_ and people don't wanna do that . we probably have to get going , don't we ? we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so i'm i'm gonna continue with my pres presentation .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ?
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this . and start if you want . is there an order ? we haven't decided on an order . no , any any order's fine . how do put this i'll just put the cable in . just you may need to but sometimes you have to do it it's like three set setting cycle , so press it couple times , hold down function and then press eight . is that it ? can you see ?
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one . so we'll just crack on , like to start with the industrial designer if it's possible . the con today is the concep today . i'll just have presentation saved it in the the folder . this meeting is the conceptual design phase and is about this . and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ? 'll just i'll load it up then . which one do , interface concept ? we've got trend watching , that's you .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals . we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , . on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . this is the power key , it's kinda like the biggest so how to turn on .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users . with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have simple interface . we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no no voice features .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ?
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ?
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . alright got some exciting for you . just what needed was something exciting . remember , i'm an old man . ready to go ? so we've got our conceptual design meeting . i'm old as .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . who is gonna do powerpoint presentation ? think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll .
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . and know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . so first let's go through this powerpoint . wonder what button press ? or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting . we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . we're gonna get to know each other little bit better . tool training , we're going to , , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . we're gonna make project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . i'm cat person . i'm allergic to cats . i'm allergic to cats , too . if you're around one had roommate who was allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , , it's weird . in my next life . , if you're around them for long period of time , , this summer , had to live with cats .
so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? three presentation , . shall go first again ? so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , . any of you think of like the the old torches which you wind up . there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more . and then there's solar cells . as final option .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product . so that when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . so again , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we'll we'll make final final decision . and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether it is practical to use long lasting one . and our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . this is first concept of our controller . the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so so the the user the the user interface should be very very cute , very very attractive . with this advanced features we we can attract lot of user . there this is the three concepts of our controller . have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap to zap between channels . so some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . do you think they will be able to use gestures ? because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , they will get injuries because of that ? if you cannot find your controller , you can just just just speak something such as , , one two . that's good that's good point , so . but suppose you got cold . you have mute remote controller . so you can use your gesture . that's no problem . do you we're far from television it will work ? no no no it's not that's that's not problem because you you don't have to wear microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . but where is the controller ? where is the controller ? it's in your family , in your home . no , but then it's it's like this .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs . or you can put it in the shared folder . you see the email ? you get email , . from the account manager . you have received the same email , ? it's for your to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . so each of us has role to do . assign your roles . so we have to plan how how it would be developed and how we can make it work . working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . and it should not be very costly . so about the about what ?
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . three presentations , you can go in any order you choose .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever . this is button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it it brings up the menu . and the base of the remote control , which has squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ?
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , . that is three . effectively one slide and we can discuss everything . so , this is our product or prototype . this is made by clay .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . in the meantime closing things down , . let's see what this thing does . does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? we came up together , we're good . are we ready to start ? it's now quarter of four . this is another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to sarah present the evaluation criteria . we then have finance aspect , which is spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and you're all thinking of , my , because we're only given forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . so we're going to make very fast track . and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , . one , two , three , four , five , six . we'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . interface button push button interface . it's just button . that's what we're using , isn't it ?
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway . for coming to this meeting . how we doing on our remote ? we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if 't get things moving along here little bit better . and then teletext was the next . volume and then power . and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . so we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine lot of the functions into one button . the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so tracking device of some sort would be good idea . they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as . anything i've missed ? so if you want to present your prototype go ahead . to record it and haven't been asked to submit it yet . just wondering if need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then . it keeps getting too big . next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i'm playing with the play-doh as . just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ? or our work on setting this up . is it i'll just go through your system then . the the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , , as in other words this this room is centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just debating , but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we put out our ideas and then , . do you feel though that that you were able to have quite lot of creative input into the thing ? but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . so what do we do . we're told terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like formality then an actual within the constraints the . you feel like you're caged within whatever it's like balloon in cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . the constraints do come in very fast . do what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , . so still on the topic of room for creativity next up is craig . agree with his point it's it is quite lot of fun to go and then you have hit the end then go , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also very strong factor , and structure . because for brainstorming meeting you want structure thows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . and that point about the room not being very friendly to that , that's very big thing , and the fact that we're wearing these things restricts feel it 'cause wear my glasses , , and that but that irritates me it it it does actually affect how , whether you feel comfortable to communicate . from like your personal coach person and like that , do you think ? it's it's good . my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership gives people certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take ownership and , innovative thought with . in in reality here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original briefing and then the personal coach and the and then having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite quite quite con confining framework to work within . and so it is leadership almost to the point of disempowering the the the team member , so but it's not bad leadership , it's just fairly strong , . it turns it turns the individual into more of like predetermined mechanism , as opposed to free , , without without doubt . so you think little too controlling or . controlling is not the word , the interactions are very structured . not co confining . structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . don't think there's sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of , like consensus , we go around and we think about it , but that process actually says you have to do it in certain way . it doesn't tell you , , some ways that you might wanna be bit more creative in terms of the process , not the you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but it just comes back to us so slow in the email it it doesn't have , , messenger will go . what about teamwork ? did , you wanna comment craig ? reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier . did did you get the email sent you ? no , not really . what about the how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , like that ? did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un unsupportive ? the whiteboard , for me , is the thing would use all the time , but it's not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on board as opposed to in like in text . and then we could then keep our ideas building on that . know that people who design cars and in aviation they quite often just have simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as context to walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . and point at ? it wasn't until we had this here , , like at one point peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like , now he's thinking 'cause saw his book . but the the whiteboard could've actually been this continuing think could be , . so do you think producing prototype earlier in the process woulda been good idea ? the the focus of it lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and that is also does hinder us and things . it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint , or the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , in the centre of the that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings . because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush , , or whatever , would've actually used it , 'ca , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . 'cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent lot of time doing that . and lot of the information on the powerpoints , don't think , , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides , felt that they just as opposed to having to present them . no , not quite . what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? they're bit clunky . having to tick it before you go off was bit hindering as , 'cause you're half way through thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . know , at the very start of today like wrote whole load of , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it , but they'll have my paper anyway and haven't done that since . but the pen is is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry . so the pen's good . it's about the best thing . and on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . it just occurred to me that they all we only actually needed one computer . we only needed one computer and and the computer may not be conducive to meeting because you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , , it's useful but too many computers are just distracting . if there had been fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . do you think the computers just provide distraction in meeting ? what else any wh do i'm not really what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today ? is this for the project or . the main one for me is that the process na in natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . so , that's new idea for me is like just that idea , it's hard to keep working forward on team team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . if we just had . it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , there another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but . you can wear homer , you can throw homer when you're frustrated , doh . no , that's , it's got i'm i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , that would have been . from now on real reaction should give us more money . did learn something new , play-doh is useful . no it is it is . it is useful and in in in in in in in conceptualizing , in being creative . 'cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get sense for . like we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh rather than with everything else . you might wanna write that down . it's just , i'm just fiddling with the play-doh , and i'm going it's kinda . and it helps you to understand dimension as . that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on piece of paper , on computer , on board , even with three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires lot of tangible , that's word . it's not very tangible . it becomes tangible . if there's anything else we needed to discuss . that that's about it really .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ? so it seems like feasible thing to implement for for limited . but if you wanna look into that just to just to check . so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then we're going to get anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . but , , , . don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls . now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design . what's the the project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if if if anybody wants to briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ? you able to look ? this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . the wide choice of colours and patterns , so you've got you've got lot of customisation with it . it's an clam-shell design and the the top screen that you can see that would would be how do you say , it's , it would be inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would so so it'll fully close flat . the black and white touch screen wherein people can . so it's flush . it's quite similar to what it was before , though . this stage of the evaluation is really for us as team to evaluate if we have now got product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . so this is the first stage of the evaluation . now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? now the findings that we came up with , just recap , are here .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ?
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control .
do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , . or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . that might scare me . any thoughts on that ? that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ?
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . and then the buttons are actually poking through rather than on top . and the buttons will be much lighter blue , almost see-through . it's just very pale blue and light-up yellow . the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . and then at the bottom we have our logo .
we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim . we are creating new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ?
good afternoon again . so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . so here is the agenda for today . just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro . so let's go . if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through we took this following decisions . no , no speech recognition technology , , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . so let this wonderful thing . so we can go to the slides . you can pull it out first , . we've got the two scroll wheels here which one on the the left for the volume and the one on the for for the channel and underneath we have the the turbo button which is in like trigger position for for pressing quite naturally . what's the use of the turbo button already ? this is when you when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to to skip past channels that you quickly rather . an then you stop when you stop it stops . when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .
it's gonna be . rock and roll . so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . i'll go first . what's components design . presented by name . my name is . jose he man is . your name is name ? my name is name . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . did this in bit of rush . prepare to die . so so here's look inside your really old-looking remote control .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ? at the same time , if it's dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or you can let them to do that . and you want for coming back to one point you want to let the user to programming the keys ? two thirty five supposed to finish . some of them ? and isn't that too difficult for the we want if we still want the r_c_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise . no but the if you give it depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . if we're talking about the area just . we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . so what else ? there's plastic for that area around the button . and then rubber would be the squishy like thing ? and lots of special colours actually . 'cause we've all we all our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . end of meeting . you have to tell her , she we have to fill in all this . so that's all for today . it would be good idea , like it . it's hard enough to get people actually paying attention .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ? my name is eileen .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . i'm gonna check that out for second . what time is it anyw you're . evaluation criteria is next in line . there we go . come on my computer . my computer's giving me technical difficulties .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ? just trying to move mine now . courtney would you mind starting us off ?
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it .
so , hello everyone . we're here to have kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for new remote control . i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin . so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . so we want to to do new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . this is first concept of our controller . the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so so the the user the the user interface should be very very cute , very very attractive . such like this , there are several examples in the slides . i'm not the one in the middle is very attractive .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? that's the mute . it it'd probably have to be labelled mute . but , we didn't have anything small enough to write . they're thinking for the first time , was hard to get the the actual labelling on the individual buttons . we just chose simple shapes for all them . the important ones are the volume ones . an important consideration . so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the , . so we've got detail design meeting . so so , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but it would . but other than that , we got the red apple . or would that be . we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour . so you were talking about we're assuming the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which may or may not be the case . shall we save the point two for profitability then ? we've for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . shall we go in the order that you just did it ? how do hook my screen up ? you might have to disconnect rose . there's wee wee plug just just that one there that's it , . where does it go ? i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ? it's it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . looks like , , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in . it's like double . but it's , , we put the fashion in electronics . so we gotta keep that in that in mind . so we want something that looks good and is yellow .
good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . my name's bob mor . and you are ? in the project ? in the project i'm supposed to be the technic . so my name's bob morris .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ?
so , ready ? no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one . that one might have to be based on the the idea was that it could connect up for allowing software interface on the p_c_ for larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such , easy minimal design , normally . programmable memory as . the u_s_b_ for which ? for the remote control . we've definitely talking some type of different . but didn't they just say it's just for t_v_ , or are we gonna , .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . so we we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change of one sort . was thinking just for the volume , but what what do you think ? just for the volume , . we could , . 'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , , . it's it's it , it it it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there's no no possibility of confusing the two .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them . and we we thought that for our our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and and as real reaction product .
is everyone ready to start ? welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . on the agenda for this , , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes . you mean the social target group who we wants to target ? that's the big question . so and then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll we'll have lunch . why anna can you do you have presentations ? no , don't . you don't have presentation ? you want table to to yes yes you can can just talk about it or you can use the whiteboard if necessary .
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . what's the big blue thing ? that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button . and then it also has digit for muting the and then then you can also there's numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we t's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . that certainly does . so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them . something that the whiteboard thingy , that's . but pen with camera on it , don't t's such new thing . it's or in such new idea . it would be different if it was hand writing recognition , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on computer screen as picture file rather than actual text . they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . we should end this , since we're off off topic .
that's design thing that you can can discuss , . , and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . to make something flush with the case ? something bit more flush , , or have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also plastic i've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . sp kinda grippy ? feel like fruit .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the . i'm the user interface designer . hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . and am hemant , the industrial designer . for being here . so let's have look to the the agenda . so , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to to make to to be used to the tools available in this and smart meeting room we have here . then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of of web . and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else . so they did this in in charlotte's web that movie that little t's actually book first but at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . so , that's my animal . guillermo you want to ?
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role . in the function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out .
she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway . so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . so my name is petre . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . my name's bob mor . and you are ? in the project ? in the project i'm supposed to be the technic . so my name's bob morris . i'm the marketing expert for this project . my name is hamed getabdar , and i'm going to be interface designer in this project . so , , so today we are doing short meeting to present the project , so we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . we are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , . so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design new remote control . so it should be , , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . that mean it's very challenging project , and . so it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . so , so what's what are we going to do during this all this project ? you can draw it , if you want . would like to see how it looks like . it may be like cow or , whatever . i'm not good very good in drawing . so this is very it's bird , . what is it . and our expected profit will be around fifty million euro . and we are trying to to have market all around the world . so not only for switzerland , but for the world . the we expect production cost of maximum twelve point fifty euro . per unit , . so we can start today to have first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like back light . and it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . so something like this . and the second thing , second point from me would be that in normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control . but prefer like potential-meter like . some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which , but reach in one second mute it down , or or make high volume .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . can have the laptop over here , or ? you have to come here .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . what colour were we gonna make it ? put leopard print on it . would sa would say give give selection of colours . we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . know , but but by this it's more case of fruit and veg , .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , , the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's very important fact , 'cause if they say , , go home and think about it , that won't work . also mentioned was it should be it should have very short learning curve . and it could be sold by using slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and display clock so that people could you could see the time , , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and some holder for the for the item . francino who is our interface designer has mentioned that the that it , , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have channel lock . particularly with small children that they couldn't watch channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped . and have an anar alarm-clock . and the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly timer to so that people can program their favourite program on from the remote . are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? that is it . then we i'm looking for three presentations . and whether the order matters much , don't don't , so whoever wants , . now my slide , . come on , close already . and that's number two , ? if you are watching french program and you would like to have subtitles in english , then there should be channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen . then there should there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be memory switch . there should be mute button . suddenly if if if viewer he gets telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the t_v_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v_ . now the most important feature would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . it's it's gonna be little bit too unwieldy . have to come back to that later . no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . ho who wants to go next ? the next one , . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works . can you go to the next slide , . have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it's it's it this is normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and the case . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something bright , colourful . bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . and also strong . trendy design and compact . trendy design , compact and strong .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . fair enough , for the input , 's always good . so , all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , , and gonna go through you , whoever wants to go first is fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . and then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . so , perfect . i'll go first . alright nathan , take it away . it is nathan ? i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? no nathan's fine . it's either nathan or participant two .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics . goin i'm going to share with you . and we decided to to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on on on the working design .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert . just down here ? what are we doing next ? we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . can we just go over that again ? so bas at twel alright , . like on the shelf . imagine that's good question . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . gosh , should be writing all this down . away i'm making some assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . so i'm wondering away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or . like how much does , , remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off . it fell that's why . it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick .
so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? only , , received my emails later on . 'cause was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not not very good part of team-working thing . but there we go . i'm it's fine . so was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to allow person to have portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so i've been looking at the components design . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . so that fruit and vegetables thing . actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and so so , let me get this . t's trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics . but you're not gonna wear your remote control . , alright anyway . here we go . so that's wh why was thinking you may need to have some screen because so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just see like some thing where like you have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on . you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or ? my flatmates actually had one with wheel , and it it did show up on the t_v_ . then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to . 'cause you'll have to like but you can quickly you can . they have to wheel really fast . you wouldn't don't don't think you would even need it . so mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard . so we have to look into the , , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's . how they make the menu show up on the t_v_ ? it would would that would be . they already do it .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ?
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so here's our agenda for today . we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . can have the laptop over here , or ? you have to come here .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ?
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , your colour and slogan is down at the bottom there . just to say quickly would have thought that only being used for television the macro facility may now not be required . or at its functionality would have been of limited use . so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so . and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . so i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . sh would you like to i'll just do it from here .
like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea . it's good idea . so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ . and then actual numbers for channels as , . you say that's required one or requested one ? which was that ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . do you wanna recap on that , craig ? we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic possible . on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to channel . and is it going to include any of the the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert . hope saved it . so , , this is my name . know this name . we met before . so as , you you already know me , sammy benjo . am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . it is put five . the full page presentation , . in the full page because spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . so what suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful . don't forget about that . so we've we've conducted survey on on the use of remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . so what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . first of all , they find it very ugly .
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the the final the final details . the the the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the the the next thing we we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and and then we can close . so if if you'd like to present your your proposals .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself . i'm fabien cardinaux and you can present yourself . so , you can starts . you can call me petre , or peter if you like . my name's bob mor . and you are ? in the project ? in the project i'm supposed to be the technic . so my name's bob morris . it's in it's beautiful . have to remember it . so good so , let's talk about money . we are going to to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five euro euro . and our expected profit will be around fifty million euro . and we are trying to to have market all around the world . so not only for switzerland , but for the world .
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . so will first what ? no you do the minutes first , or ? will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . no no we we we we just are use no no we just have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . if you if if you use the basic but it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . some some efficient . so you won't cost an not lot for us ? it's because this technology is for limited wor or limited wor lexical recognition , it's very it's . it's no it's even for the because the the vocabulary the the vocabulary is very small , so that's not problem .
no it's the all around camer microphone isn't it . the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only single mic or microphone array ? so it's microphone array . it's very costly , microphone array . no it's just single microphone , and you we we put it here because when you when you are browsing your you will be close to t's better to to to place it here than here , . the excuse me ? whole day's rating . what type of battery ? it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . we we designed the two items . yes but we yes , we should phone him . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . yes but we yes , we should phone him . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents . it's he said to me when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . there is no no negotiation possible in this matter . so we have to consider that . so anna , you can have your presentation . can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have design . you are here . ma then you can start now with presenting your your designs . so will start by the the basic one that fits into eight euros actually , , seven eight euros , and first for both they have special shape , the designer can explain better than me , but it's like surf board . and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t_v_ , the web , and it's interesting shape because unconsciously people want to to surf when they see this . and also it's not too far from mobile . so people are used to that shape , . don't take care too much about the colour because we don't take . now we are supposed to give some oper offers now . so here would be the the the infrared led l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , the on-off button , in red . here would be the volume . on the on the left , , so easy to turn on and off . and so this is very cheap version so there are you can carry on matthew . also so you have browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , , if you have video you can forward , back . how can you change from v_c_r_ to t_v_ , by the way ? no no no , this is single this this is model with just the t_v_ one . no no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that . so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . 'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have . and then you must just see it we can still spend this four and half euro and to because the the selling price is already prite fik quite fixed on twenty five euros so we just have to offer as much as as value for the for the customer he can have for twenty five euro . so look and feel , innovation . and now it easy to use . easy to use . you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ? is that part of both of them or ? and the and the second one is really state of the art , in terms of innovation . and with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . it gives it . and the screen is that's that's that's t's quite innovative . and all the scrolling buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . could put it at one or two would say .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there . then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . and then that's it . so we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ? so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s . the excuse me ? whole day's rating . what type of battery ? it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . it's the same things as presented before . but here we have we have four buttons for navigation . press one button acting as enter button . so according to what you said it's more robust to the user . and it's also cheaper to produce . we can produce such remote control for about four dollars .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
there you go . you can harness the awesome power little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s and things we like about the city , we'll so moving on to not fun project finance . what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but , i'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty that's like forty bucks for remote . it would have to like do my laundry for me . so what we can work on that later but we're gonna make lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ?
welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . let's do the look and feel design presentation first . do you wanna start ?
used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? let's have your let's get have the presentation ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ? is that alright ? keeps coming off . how do we sta wa how do we start ? does anybody know ? so that's this , .
good morning everybody . everybody is not ready . so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in few minutes . so will be sebastian the project manager . you are the .
hope you have good lunch . we had falafel . yes , had something similar but non-vegetarian . so today is our third meeting . it will be about the conceptual design . investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you . what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel . so now more more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . what colour were we gonna make it ? put leopard print on it . would sa would say give give selection of colours . we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . know , but but by this it's more case of fruit and veg , .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? do you want to start ? you can start . cable , camera . you have powerpoint ? should be in my in their folder no ? who are you ? and we have technical problem . do we think in the in the wrong folder ? it is possible . you put it on . it was somewhere in something like this .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two . this this is what we have decided in the last meeting . so the first thing have done is to to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic kinetic technique to to store the energy . we also we also can put regular battery in the in the remote control .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ? and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . as if you'd wanted to . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build whole whole system , 'cause they can't give you anything comparable to the internet for the , . it kinda thought that felt like would go and like try to use my information , or like i'd make this stupid little presentation and then like would end up talking about something completely unrelated because felt like was off-task all the time . it's interesting how it all went together , like had the about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and it seems planned . we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess ? if hadn't been told that fruit was they're pretty .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . and people lose them .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . thought my leadership was crap personally . excuse me , am allowed to say that ? you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . you were fine . you did good job leading . 'm never gonna do management position , know that now .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other . it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . the tool training is to try out the white board , so you can draw your favourite animal and make list of its favourite characteristics . someone ha we have to this whiteboard , ? if we have to do it now , later later .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we've got tool training . try out whiteboard . so we will . so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . this is make the whiteboard works . so who wishes to go first . pens are over here . the three pens are underneath . i'll try the red pen . i'm gonna go for the bear which i'm be able to draw very , but i'll have bash at it . you get marks for artistic impression . lost it there .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting .
everybody is ready ? good morning again . so , today we are going to have second meeting . michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? so yes including the power supply as . i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , . any of you think of like the the old torches which you wind up . there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one .
so , hi christa . so , now it's the hi sammy . it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype . then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as team . and that's all . so first , let's see the prototype .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .
so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
so we are here for for functional design . so we are here for the functional design meeting so first will show the agenda so we will will take notes during this meeting so will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then will present you some new project requirements received from the management board . then we will take the decision on on the remote control needed functions and then will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or we could have everything generic but there are lot of remotes on the market now and this is most of the almost everybody has this . and and voice command did you . voice command we could specify anything . we could assign any button command to any button , if we have enough processing power , so . so that's that close your investigations ? not so far .
here we go . alright , the agenda for thi . the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that that we gave gave it . and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . and evaluate the product , as group . and so first we'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the powerpoint for this ? got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design . what's the the project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if if if anybody wants to briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so . i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves , we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make .
no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . so that indicates our technological advancement . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way .
that's not gonna work . i'll just put that there . as you all know we're here to create brand new fantastic remote . i'm nick debusk , i'm the project manager . we'll just get started with everyone letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . am corinne whiting and will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases will have different role .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ?
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . no no no , this is single this this is model with just the t_v_ one . no no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that . so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . the extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel . and the other one is for the teletext you want to browse through from that . so it's it's very basic remote then , it's only .
so , will open our functional design meeting . so , will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and what's your talk ? and after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . so suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . the first will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote t_v_ control . will focus on user interface design . so move to the next slide . as we know our remote rem remote t_v_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . there's lot of functions . over , over twelve or twenty functions of remote t_v_ control .
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule .
you all is it about , you all received the email , . we are actually doing this meeting to start new project which is about designing remote control . so i'm going to be the project manager of this project . and so i'm present myself .
that went , . alright , let me just powerpoint this up . so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . fair enough , for the input , 's always good . so , all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , , and gonna go through you , whoever wants to go first is fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . and then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . so , perfect .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . and they can be very very affectionate . some people don't but know very affectionate cats . and they can look after themselves . i'll i'll shall see if get across without just tangling everything . shall rub that out , actually ? don't see as there's any need to . so experience with remote control , first ideas . so we're looking at having discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our our new model as it were . so any any thoughts ? with some remote controls the buttons were little small so they're quite hard to press so we make something with easy to press buttons . as that is the main function . so so we're looking for some we're looking for device that is robust and and therefore won't get damaged too easily .
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . three presentations , i've got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ? is it if postpone that til later , want to get access to little bit more information , is that ? no that's fine , that's fine . i'll go first . can grab the . what do have to press ?
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . but then other functionalities could be just there could be menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu . and , the last question had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . so at the for the time being that's that's all . if you have questions , and also it's it's other question is because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . if that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had decent case for that we really t's important to include video and d_v_d_ , could get back to them and see . it's it's just whether it's worth arguing about .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ?
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . this is meeting on functional design . and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between . did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment . know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . is this ap everybody agree with this ? and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . and if we devote some energy into this , the recent productions of real reaction , the go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , we can also use this as platform to make it interact with other tools . and the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our designed tool . so again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . fifty percent of all these numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are lot of television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on remote control that looks fancy . could can ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started . here is the agenda for today's meeting . we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . and we have forty minutes again . and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control . let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . so we can go ahead and go to the next . so what they want . now customers want fancy versus functional . about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . so the customer is confused . they exactly what they want .
or you get it . no don't it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . so we we will for anna , few minutes . yours is but the the mic should not . you can put anywhere you want , actually . thin it's not directional mic , anyway . it should work like this . so will try to get my presentation running . can't help you with that . it's no matter . then press al this . on this normal good . so , good morning , everyone . welcome at at the kick off meeting of our latest project . hope you all have been updated about it . so we will try to structure this meeting with an with an agenda as presented here . after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . see what our roles are in this project . so it needs to be trendy . trendy is what people want , so then they will buy our product . but then , , it also should work user friendly and otherwise people will not be be rated very consumer articles and like that . so , the general outline of new project will be we first go through functional design phase . you all get certain task in this in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design . and the same holds for the ph two phases after this , the conceptual design and after that more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .
first time this time . nu there we go . it's not that complicated , but get it wrong every time . so we are just waiting for matthew . for matthew , . so suggest we start the meeting without matthew he's late for some reason . today we will talk about conceptual design . hope you both did some some work concerning conceptual design . this will be the agenda for the meeting . will take some minutes again . we will have the presentations of of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ?
so i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . and then i'm gonna turn over to you to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have bit of discussion . so what i've just found out from the board if you got this email as but it needs to be television only . so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote . it also needs to have the company colours included in it . so that's red and black . and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . and no teletext .
talk about it but have no slides or anything . 've just been presented with some research we've done in small focus group so , hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in remote control . it's probably can't email this to you , i've just got web page with some data on it . it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . seventy five seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project . our project project is to create new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so the project method is the following . so if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other . it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so i've been looking at the components design . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . so that fruit and vegetables thing . actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and so so , let me get this . t's trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics . but you're not gonna wear your remote control . , alright anyway . here we go . so that's wh why was thinking you may need to have some screen because so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just see like some thing where like you have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on . you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or ? my flatmates actually had one with wheel , and it it did show up on the t_v_ . then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to . 'cause you'll have to like but you can quickly you can . they have to wheel really fast . you wouldn't don't don't think you would even need it . so mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard . so we have to look into the , , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's . how they make the menu show up on the t_v_ ? it would would that would be . they already do it .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?
alright , that did nothing . welcome to the meeting everyone . just gonna attempt to make this into slide show . you may have to do the function eight thing . this'll just take moment . or it won't . we'll have to deal with it like this then . this is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . our next meeting will be in half an hour . so you have half an hour to , , think about what you want to present . or not present but bring to the meeting . i_d_ , whatever that stands for . have to remember these things . you'll be beginning your , your working design .
welcome to the the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control . this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company . and to that end we need all to work together to do that . and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the the the user interface and kate with the the industrial design . what's the the project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . in in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if if if anybody wants to briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so . i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves , we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . so we'll start with andrew . my name's andrew i'm i'm the market research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and i'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and haven't had whole lot of experience in this thing before but i'm so i'll be working on the design . at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so . i'm just open to being creative .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? just give us bit of switching around those on the electronics we got the sample sensor . so , that would that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there's nothing else as far as see that we we had planned to put on . at the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech so if we got rid of like the one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without , .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started . here's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . gonna come to decision on the functions of the remote control . do you want me to run it or you wanna . you should run it . now we have courtney with the functional requirements . yes , so we tested hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . seventy five percent think they're ugly . eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us if we make it look fancier , and we just need something that really there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple .
good morning everybody . so , we are asked to to make new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . we should set the the points to to drive the project and , from the account manager . did you send us an email about this ? not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ? we we received an email about this designs . or you can put it in the shared folder . you see the email ? the very no , no the first one . no , didn't get it .
and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . remote control , like , so we have to look at the life also . so the the the if you if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , , don't think you'd the it would how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , it's not gonna add anything , . it would , . can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's little compact mirror and when you press button it then goes onto the phone display the remote control display thing . we're marketing to as much as we are to women . they don't look at themselves ? t's remote control , you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to open it and say shit should go and have shower and do my hair before put the t_ , no , no . you mean , it's with us using the ideas for mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones kinda got sidetracked onto that , . trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but we'll leave that one on the side .
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .
am starting now ? alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and hope you had productive last thirty minutes . and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today . so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation . and , so , ? so , , take it away poppy . only , , received my emails later on . 'cause was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not not very good part of team-working thing . but there we go . i'm it's fine . so was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to allow person to have portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .
so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . so will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation . we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good . how to to design this this . so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert . so if do that like this ? so it's being modified . do you want , open . hope saved it . so , , this is my name . know this name . we met before . so as , you you already know me , sammy benjo . am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . it is put five . the full page presentation , . in the full page because spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . so what suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful . don't forget about that . so we've we've conducted survey on on the use of remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . so what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . first of all , they find it very ugly . current remote controls as they're the same as this one they're not colour , not shape , they're all the same , and they're not good looking . what is interesting is that it seems that they were people are ready to pay for and look and fancy looking remote control , so we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that . and the other thing is that the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . no , don't . because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high . so , it seems that it's lot of people for concept that we but we have to take this into account . but twenty six percent , do twenty five . every fourth , . it's people really . every four some of us knows . so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration of the user and what else do have ? one of us .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ? thes these are the kind different batteries that the company makes , ? does that mean like wind-up one ? so if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so they'll they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options . so the third one is the kinetic energy ones . you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v_ . and charging their remote , .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different .
good morning everybody . i'm glad you could all come . i'm really excited to start this team . i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . my name is rose lindgren . i'll be the project manager . our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise . and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . first of all our project aim . we are creating new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . and one thing particularly like is if you are not moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . there is way around that , but my residence now the the television you have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so it's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , and that's if we're gonna make remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like lithium battery that would last lot longer than like double a_s . something that doesn't . like tho those are the batteries that are used in lot of m_p_ three players now and that thing .
so to see you again . tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes . so we will see our three presentations . we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . can have the laptop over here , or ? you have to come here . have to get up . it should stay . should stay in the square here . so i'm gonna present some findings of study we conducted into what users want in this remote control . you can put it here . that's , it's jus . so first of all we what we did is we conducted an experiment with hundred test subjects .
so we can start ? suppose have to do my presentation . so , i'll present myself , i'm ada longmund , and as you may , i'm the pr project manager . it's ada longmund ? so we will have to speak about the project .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule .
minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .
it fell off . one , two , three , four , , we're ready . welcome to this second meeting . it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off .
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . we just refreshed our our goal of making the finest remote control available . we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users . with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before . the simple versus the the complex . the simple one being better for user , the complex better for an engineer . and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be user-oriented remote , something simple . and that we didn't wanna go with universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity . we would just have t_v_ remote . and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . these are all things we've already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . so that might be bit of challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .
so see all everybody's here , . and we can start meeting . what's the agenda for this meeting ? the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you .
think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing . i'm gonna draw it on the board then . it's in blue , and couldn't change it .
did you get my email with the slides ? have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here . so what can you ? he he he you did work together didn't you ? we will , so will be able to to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer . we can put on the here . we we designed the two items . can we have phone , can someone it's really designed . when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . so just for record will take notes again . and first thing was got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents . it's he said to me when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . there is no no negotiation possible in this matter . so people are used to that shape , . don't take care too much about the colour because we don't take . now we are supposed to give some oper offers now . so here would be the the the infrared led l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , the on-off button , in red . here would be the volume . on the on the left , , so easy to turn on and off . can you get the batteries ? no no the battery has fallen down , that's . battery's low , isn't it the ink ? the that's the that that one ? no no it's not that , it's how to close battery . now it should be . you got second ? won't be able to tell . yes , it it has . is that working ? did it come out ? because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ? is that alright ?
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ?
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
hope you had good lunch . we're back for the conceptual design meeting . let's get started .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ?
is everyone here ? this is our conceptual design meeting . and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes . then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .
so we are here to talk about functional design . now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . so here's an agenda . you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful . now you can all give your presentations .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that .
are you got it all head's kinda small . how're we placed in terms of the alright . should probably try to sit up straight . mine's fallen off . it fell that's why . it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick . kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it . so just to kick off the meeting so we're working now for real reaction , this is so it . just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . we're gonna just do quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we're gonna start talk little bit about tool training . essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . we've got general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just bit of discussion close up .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
almost , there's one more thing have to get out of the have to make that this attachment will open . keep forgetting whether i've done this . we'll open that when the time is . from meeting three , is it alright with you if don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'cause this way more easily flip it . all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , each of you made your presentations . we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . the market trend of fruit and veg , spongy , fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . we decided chip on print would be used . so , are they under twelve fifty ? yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . the project process , satisfaction with , , the room for creativity . leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that good things . , the play-doh was best , .
so we come to the third meetings . so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . so we will talk about some specific details . so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two .
so so so . put on your mic . so you forgot how this works again ? so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , ? and here's the agenda for this meeting . i'm just gonna open , say few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ?
it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana . it is the essence of bananas . would be confused with this thing . how is everyone ?
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . and it comes , change the vegetable . you could change the vegetable , or fruit . this one's broccoli . so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .
we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . we've got teletext outdated . here are two example remotes . by the look of it they both have play and fast forward , rewind functions , so they incorporate video function which we won't have to worry about . but as you can see , the left remote is quite quite busy looking , quite complicated . whereas the remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . so my personal preference would be the remote . so , it's got big buttons , it's got very limited number of buttons . 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . so so what was the circular thing that you were if it's just for t_v_ , which is what it is at the moment . that's just for video , so we wouldn't need any of that . so we could get it down to what ? so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve we got fourteen that we need .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , .
welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and hope you all had good individual working time . let's get started .
so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . how was lunch ? don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . so , can we highlight the specific features of our , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . you're , you have to so you say do we agree on that ? we have to . so , do you think . so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
just need to know so write it down . that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything . so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as ? we need an . and that's because of cost restraints is it ? what about the electronics here ? we need an advanced chip , . but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . no , , . dunno do you it means it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so . on dif answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then then we're told use the co company company colours . reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier . did did you get the email sent you ? not just yet . got the email . was wondering if that got there .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes .
michael , hi . you have good reason for that ? let's have look to the agenda today . so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design . so first before starting just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . so we we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new new inputs for about that topics .
welcome to the second meeting of this design group . i'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so . we we we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour . and and we we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . good job , team . how did you get that in there ? the slightly resembling giant delicious cookie . it it does . that was good . alright , let's go back to this no , that's it .
on the or no . where to put it 'cause the . could you take it off ? is that alright ?
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as . anything i've missed ? so what do we do . we're told terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like formality then an actual within the constraints the . you feel like you're caged within whatever it's like balloon in cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . the constraints do come in very fast . do what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , . so still on the topic of room for creativity next up is craig . agree with his point it's it is quite lot of fun to go and then you have hit the end then go , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also very strong factor , and structure . because for brainstorming meeting you want structure thows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . it doesn't tell you , , some ways that you might wanna be bit more creative in terms of the process , not the you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but it just comes back to us so slow in the email it it doesn't have , , messenger will go . what about teamwork ? did , you wanna comment craig ? reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier . did did you get the email sent you ? not just yet . was wondering if that got there . so to to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . in it , , , exactly . the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , that's the word . they don't support the team working together , , they're still very individual tools . if you , taking upon that idea , the way see this is that it's the the the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork because the the tasks were divided , and then the work went on in isolation what you did while you were together , that was bit different , but , but but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said , first thing we have to do is come up with let's say design concept , and we sit here together and do it , that's what teamwork is . what else any wh do i'm not really what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today ? is this for the project or . the main one for me is that the process na in natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . so , that's new idea for me is like just that idea , it's hard to keep working forward on team team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . if we just had . it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , there another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but .
it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ? out of forty nine , . out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 's pretty good . so it's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . 'cause if you turn that into hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's , about seventy , seventy percent .
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like banana . it is banana . it is banana .
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the for the remote control . so let's see the what did you prepare . so can you go out to the shared folder ? the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ? because have here just one . so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s . and here the the switch that control if you want it's the but . why you why you you put it in the the side ? it's not good place . no it's the all around camer microphone isn't it . the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only single mic or microphone array ? so it's microphone array . it's very costly , microphone array . no it's just single microphone , and you we we put it here because when you when you are browsing your you will be close to t's better to to to place it here than here , . the excuse me ? whole day's rating . what type of battery ? it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen with just four buttons . and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or vegetable , or whatever they like . so it should be much more customised to make different shapes . and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . but the the problem is that is it robust to mishandling ? we have you should find material that is robust at the same time spongy .
i'm proud of it . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . i'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . then then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . it does look very . the speaker the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . 'cause the sample speaker was , , more complicated then just beeping thing . this would be , there you record your samples your speech samples and , then then we would be in the budget . , so we . also in the case i'm not that you will evaluate this as curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably flat surface rubber . so we need one fifty off .
hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to to reach decision . so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . so , who wants to start ?
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so here's our agenda for today . we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ? my name is eileen . my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . and as you already am betty . am the project manager for today . so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . yes opening , acquaintance , tool training , the tools are , , we already the tool is really our the computer , as far as see . we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . project plan , that falls under the same heading . don't think we have any discussion at this point . hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause don't like snakes . here's the project finance which , , we all have to think about when we design this thing . selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro . profit aim for the company is fifty million euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro . that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . so these are all things , , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . yes , exactly yes . at twelve fifty euros per who knows if we get really good designer we can do that . we certainly can try to agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . it should be something new it should be it it should do something different than than just what we have . now , , the other thing to think there is the design . design should be , it should be different . but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . , that didn't we can't do it . because you're because you're silly . then , in that case yes . because people are silly . it could be on , if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table , , we have to move along , . so you have working design and then functional design . and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . that would be your idea . and , , price . that it , that it , that the price is good price . the price is given , but , that was .
cover myself up . feel like madonna with one of these on . said feel like madonna with one of these on . i've always wanted one of these , really have . where do you buy from ? back again for another wonderful meeting . is everyone ready ? we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . that would be me . function eight it . there we go . i'm very excited by this one actually had lot of fun doing it . this is where you look at what does it take to make remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . that's about all have to do , . hope didn't go through that too quickly . just real quick question the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , . no idea , no idea . i'm assuming that kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that tita titanium is very light , know , but other than that's really basic , , that's all have gotten so far . any other questions ? if you made notes yourself you can put those on our underneath our , in your book , then don't worry about that . now we're concepts concepts of user interface . this one's so much tighter than the other one . there we go . here you are . alright , so i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . if anything , the that they gave me . it's not plugged in , quite in enough . there we are . there we go . so we're gonna look little bit at trend watching . was given an executive summary that was market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . so first they had people they ranked the important aspects of remote controls , and now they're saying that currently there's functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . and as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . that would be like if we use something like the space material or the screen , things like that . and then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . the packaging , it should be like lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . all these options . so instead of opening the box you just peel it , and the remote control's inside . there we go . the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . it's like the way it all comes all cute .
wanna find our if our remote works . here's the agenda for our last meeting . after the opening we're going to have prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . no , let's have the prototype presentation . you or me ? you read that , since you wrote it . since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . i'll be the vanna . the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . good job , team . how did you get that in there ? the slightly resembling giant delicious cookie . it it does . that was good . alright , let's go back to this no , that's it . we hadn't had any ma fallings out . minus you being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? that's it's definitely strong one . the means , the whiteboard didn't work . and no internet . have to knock that one down couple notches .
for coming to this third meeting of the design group . we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our our new remote control . i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better . they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . there we go . i'll just be talking about the components design . and , looked at what exactly do remotes do . they for you to press key or give voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the t_v_ . the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with resistor and capacitor . what happens is you'll press number or give voice command and this creates connection within the the remote thows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces signal in morse code format . that's something we should think about . also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it . also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so was thinking perhaps combination of solar cells with back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . we also need to look at the chips , custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have upon . however that's gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to to convert , so if we were definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip . and that sums it up .
just just carry on . alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point . and we should each have presentation to make . we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so here's our agenda for today . we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
any thoughts on that ? that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought . do we need an display ? what what's the functionality of that ? but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? what would it achieve ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of . l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about . and the the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is . that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday . so so no need for an display ? i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?
didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? let's have your let's get have the presentation ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . what's the big blue thing ? that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button . and then it also has digit for muting the and then then you can also there's numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we t's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . that certainly does . so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them . but then but then you can learn to use your like was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? didn't didn't think about that , but i'd , . know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . i'm they'll be able to it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , , extraordinary . everybody can press button with their left and hand so , it's not . imagine are you handed ? this is where we all get to get to write on the , , on the board . love the smell of that play-doh . have some have some . so , evaluation . we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . i've got the criterias . this isn't simulation , this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just , , they get . they're actually trying to find ideas for ideal remote . they're using our ideas . two years' time this will be on the market . ex exactly that product thum we'll go , , we designed that and no-one will believe us . but no , when this meeting's finished like officially , there we'll get questionnaire to fill in .
