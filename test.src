'd say let's start with the first presentation . in the same order as last time ? take it away . welcome you all . components design , first of all would like to accommodate some of those things elaborate some of the things did . elaborated on the concept . what should be said about the components , its properties and what materials should we use to to make one of those remote controls . first of all i've subtracted some of the components that is that are used are from what the remote control's formed . first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . would like to give you an idea of how about . which shape you should should take , but . colours the elderly people look something like that . changing colours will be easier than changing the shape of it . changing just the shape of the remote control ? perhaps you could find something in the middle . round corners , but but square , . you always have print plate , ? always , so what what we have to decide about that . t's good question . it just was in there and didn't have any information about it , but . chip on print , what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it's always clear for the remote control when you press certain button . but when you got screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , if you enlarge button , or if you got several options appearing on your screen , the co-ordinations aren't always the same .

hi everyone again . like before we have to redo the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages to the t_v_ . it should have nine channel buttons , next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have memory switch , mute button in case the telephone rings . and also compact in shape . and also it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . you used to have all the buttons that's good , no , that's and friendly . and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which which is strong and also for the the material is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber and als . because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . and then for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is fluorescent green and it's it is bulb like an ordinary infrared .

so good morning . see you all find your places . is everybody sitting on the place ? so let's see . first will introduce myself . let's do it read only . if you've noticed , but we're working for real reaction . it's company in electronics . we put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put lot of effort in design and in the product itself . i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project . this is our agenda . you can save . these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo little piece of drawing . blank new document for each person . select pen , eraser . capture we don't have to do anything with . then we've got our pen .
but all you will found that already because there are lot of documents in it already , so it will be . and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is simple tool bar . it's what said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we're going to try out the white board .
so these are the points why we also hired you . we've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look . and industrial designer there's also user friendly and bit original . and we've got our user interface designer . he's also that's about the new remote control . project method is there are three phases we are going through .

so good morning . see you all find your places . is everybody sitting on the place ? so let's see . first will introduce myself . if if everybody knows me , so i'm bart , hello . my name's frank . let's start off with little presentation . now first i'll tell you little bit about the setting . you can see there are few cameras here . they'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . there are also some microphones there but you don't have to pay lot of attention on those , because it will disappear when you don't attend to it . so is there project documents folder ? there are some notes in it already see , some documents . i'll start with the presentation kick off . is being modified by the administrator . let's do it read only . if you've noticed , but we're working for real reaction . it's company in electronics . we put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put lot of effort in design and in the product itself . i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project . this is our agenda . we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . sit down , then take some notes or let's see . you can take the minutes once in while . it's not lot of work , but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down . as you can see it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . aquaintance is point we've done bit . have you all seen the corporate website already ? but on the corporate information side there's there was real remote instead of real reaction . real remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just little fault . what are we going to do ? our project aim is as you can see new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are the points why we also hired you . so that's bit what you're going to do . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . then we've got our first tool training . we are going to work with lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have little bit of training first . as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there's little tool bar on this side . 'cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up . so we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be . now you'll see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow . that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be stripe . but , i'm just trying . this is not my work , . you have to use . it's it wants to draw another animal ? it lives for the fun . what that is ? you say blank , or . just blank sheet . was gonna draw cat too , so . i'll just try something else . something different than garfield . that's pretty clear . so everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it's pretty easy . haunted white board . we're being haunted . does it do anything ? you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show . it's off now . now you have to put it back .

everybody found his place again ? so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we're going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there's little adaptation in the air conditioning system .

'cause they're used most and so they should be robust . they shouldn't break down easily . then as mo as lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs lot . but it might be good idea to make docking station .

so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we're going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase .
this is our third meeting already . hope you enjoyed your lunch . this is the second phase we're going to discuss today . it's the conceptual design meeting . and few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . and we're going to target sixty to to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , suggest let's get started with the presentations . so shall we keep the same line-up as last time ? i'll start off then . i'm gonna inform you about the trend-watching i've done over the past few days . we've done some market research .
this is our third meeting already . hope you enjoyed your lunch . this is the second phase we're going to discuss today . it's the conceptual design meeting . and few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you're going to show me in few minutes . but first i'll show you the agenda . first the opening . after that we have to come to decision on remote control concepts . how we're going to make it . and then we're closing . we have about forty minutes . so suggest let's get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? then little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ?
this is our third meeting already . hope you enjoyed your lunch . this is the second phase we're going to discuss today . it's the conceptual design meeting . and few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . but first i'll show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to decision on remote control concepts . how we're going to make it . and then we're closing .

i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . our fourth and last meeting . there he is . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we're going to close the project today as . so after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . in order to do that we have this agenda .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . let me see . there he is . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we're going to close the project today as . so after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . in order to do that we have this agenda . we'll have the prototype presentation first . and the company logo . so it's rather simple prototype . and we'll have to see from testing how the users take it . is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? just pop in at any time . when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you go to the next teletext page . and you can compensate that as . so that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as . do we think we gonna get the twelve and half million ? or what was it ? fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product .

so , we've still got four buttons , but just so you got not not butt button itself , but on the . they count the materials . on the chip there . on the chip you've got still four four buttons . so , but . but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? easy to use ? learnability is very important factor here . is it functional ? subtitles , buttons . so we've got twenty cents for our docking station , ? should be do-able . is the design easy to use ? that's bit dodgy . would be for us .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we're going to close the project today as . so after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . in order to do that we have this agenda . we'll have the prototype presentation first . is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? easy to use ? learnability is very important factor here . is it functional ? subtitles , buttons . so we've got twenty cents for our docking station , ? should be do-able . is the design easy to use ? that's bit dodgy . would be for us .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . but they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with with little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and . just to recognise it , so and now we don't need leds or some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we don't have to use it . just for recognition . so and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . with different colour than the case . so they jump out .

i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . let me see . our fourth and last meeting . there he is . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we're going to close the project today as . so after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . in order to do that we have this agenda . we'll have the prototype presentation first .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . let me see . we'll have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and half euro per remote . so this is five buttons . and make it smaller overall . so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen behi under that , than the scroll button you get much smaller remote . and then you can . and it sh ? so we can decrease this one to four buttons .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . let me see . our fourth and last meeting . there he is . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we're going to close the project today as . so after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . so we can decrease this one to four buttons . now we have five . but , you can make quite big remote remote control for just the same price as small one . just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . that's no problem . it it's bit .

before start with the with the meeting have few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , because we're being watched by big brother . by big brother ? this these are cameras , so are these . that's two things really close to each other . but at the same time user-friendly . and they have , that's very important for them . there are three stages . there is functional design . so what are we going to to do ?

see my bunny is still standing . no one drawing it . it's too beautiful . figured that much . minute , my laptop is , there it is , . so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the the things you worked on the last half hour . will take minutes and will put the minutes that have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . had an email from the from the management board , if you al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the the main focus . second one is also important , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it's not gonna be multi-purpose remote control , so that's one thing to keep in mind . second , and that's important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the the the slogan and the and the logo to to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the the the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the the word files , what you whatever you want . we have three audiences of two audiences , i'm . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an screen on the remote control , speech recognition .

just , no , that's for me , have to make some notes . got my mouse . also forgot my mouse , but don't need my mouse , . there we are . my laptop is crashing . cr help help help . let's just check one more time . can you hear me ? actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again . made simple presentation . so you put some things in it . how does this work ? one most to the . yes that one . so that's my name , . the the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . and we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market . and the third thing is the detailed design and that's exa , what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . so no , this is these are two smartboards , with the an introduction of that one . and you already saw all that that you here can put things in the the red project map . folder , yes .
you have to put it exactly on the on the . took your mouse . should bring my pen too ? just , no , that's for me , have to make some notes . got my mouse . also forgot my mouse , but don't need my mouse , . there we are . my laptop is crashing . cr help help help . let's just check one more time . can you hear me ? actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again . yes , it's working . so you all read what we are going to do or not ? we're gonna make remote control . my laptop is bit etchy . made simple presentation . so you put some things in it . how does this work ? one most to the . yes that one . so that's my name , . we're going to make remote control , you already know that . and we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market . and the third thing is the detailed design and that's exa , what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . so no , this is these are two smartboards , with the an introduction of that one . and you already saw all that that you here can put things in the the red project map . folder , yes . so no have look at that one . so what we that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros . and we have to make profit of fifty million euros , so we have to use big market in europe . piece of cake . the production cost are about half the price of selling price , . so can someone make calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , . so we're gonna have little discussion about what experience are with remote control the and everything , so just have look how it we think about remote controls . my first question was does it have to be universal remote control ? no , just everything . so , what what what's remote control , it's just black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but , . can try to make it special . so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user . about making it the same style as the television , we don't have the same television all the time , so that's no matter . if we control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it it has to be clear , because kids and elderly are gonna use it , so it's not only for the technical persons . it must be very good control , so you can act use it from everywhere in your room , the the infrared thing must be from very good quality . should be good point . nothing it shouldn't be too big , but don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have lot of functions , so .
you have to put it exactly on the on the . took your mouse . should bring my pen too ? just , no , that's for me , have to make some notes . got my mouse . also forgot my mouse , but don't need my mouse , . there we are . my laptop is crashing . cr help help help . let's just check one more time . can you hear me ? actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again . yes , it's working . so you all read what we are going to do or not ? we're gonna make remote control . made simple presentation . so you put some things in it . how does this work ? one most to the . yes that one . so that's my name , . we're going to make remote control , you already know that . just have look , are we going to this agenda of our meeting . this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . so the thing we have to you already we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , . so , , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . first we have three steps of making the the remote control . fir the first thing is the functional design , that's very important . we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the next meeting . the the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . and we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market . you have to draw favourite animal on the whiteboard and and say why it's your favourite animal . so and you have this is just to try it out and we have to use different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . so , so first have to show you , you can come here to have look how it works . see it now . this new page , it's . use pen format . and different colour can use here no take the pink . you take there's no pink , , just purple , . and line width ten . half past ten . now we just have to save everything , so . this is definitely the best one . so what we that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros . and we have to make profit of fifty million euros , so we have to use big market in europe . piece of cake . how much is your standards mobile phone recharger ? if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but what the project projection costs are for such thing . have , 'cause . if you look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because it's too expensive . but home station is really good idea , because lots of people are lose their remote control and where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . it's therefore it's good idea , but it's expensive . just is that ? there's already document in the folder about it . so see you in thirty minutes . for the next time you have to put it exactly on the square , so your laptop . it didn't say that . it didn't say that .
you have to put it exactly on the on the . took your mouse . should bring my pen too ? just , no , that's for me , have to make some notes . got my mouse . also forgot my mouse , but don't need my mouse , . half past ten . now we just have to save everything , so . this is definitely the best one . so what we that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros . and we have to make profit of fifty million euros , so we have to use big market in europe . piece of cake . how much is your standards mobile phone recharger ? if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but what the project projection costs are for such thing . have , 'cause . if you look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because it's too expensive . but home station is really good idea , because lots of people are lose their remote control and where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . it's therefore it's good idea , but it's expensive .

first of all i'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . if you if you al already had look or not ? did you do your questionnaire already ? no already did it . it's not much . it's just one question . it wants but everything is . if you look closely , you can see . already took the liberty to make some suggestions . at the moment we have fifteen buttons , one screen , one advanced chip-on-print . we use sensor , that's for the speech . we use kinetic energy . and drop it ? let's drop the speech . fo four less euros . so we still have three and half euro to lose . we need to lose some buttons . if you lose the the back , the button let's say we only have the four arrows , and the menu button .
first of all i'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . if you if you al already had look or not ? did you do your questionnaire already ?
