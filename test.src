this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert . i'm craig and i'm user interface . so we're designing new remote control and have to record who's here actually . so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ? and you all arrived on time . so des design new remote control . as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . so that's our our brief , as it were . and so there are three different stages to the design . i'm not really what what you have already received in your emails . what did you get ? that's that's it . is that what everybody got ? did you get the same thing ? so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . so you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . so who would like to go first ? so this one here , ? my favourite animal is like beagle . charac favourite characteristics of it ? , high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take lot of physical affection from their family . and , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health . so this is blue . my family's beagle . my favourite animal would be monkey . then they're small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , i'm gonna be up there with them . there's too much gear . you can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . tail's bit big , . was gonna choose dog as . but i'll just draw different dog . my favourite animal is my own dog at home . that doesn't really look like him , actually . he looks more like pig , actually . what kind is it ? he's mixture of various things . and what do like about him , that's just to suggest that his tail wags . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very affectionate and and he's quite quite wee as so he can doesn't take up too much space . and and he does funny thing where he chases his tail as , which is quite amusing , so it is . is he aware that it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?
nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway . so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , .
just down here ? what are we doing next ? we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . away i'm making some assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . so i'm wondering away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or . like how much does , , remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .
or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one . know my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . so for them it was just how many devices control . so , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses so . so do you think that should be like main design aim of our remote control , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , . or even like , , notes about what you wanna watch . like you might put in there want to watch such and such and look that's good idea . so extra functionalities . like , personally for me , at home i've i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them . and and that's the end of the meeting . so got that little message lot sooner than would , so . before we wrap up , just to make we're all on the same page here , , do we we were given an example of coffee machine , ? are we at ma now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ? just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ? and you all arrived on time . so des design new remote control . as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . so that's our our brief , as it were . and so there are three different stages to the design . that's that's it . is that what everybody got ? did you get the same thing ? so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . superb sketch , by the way . tail's bit big , . was gonna choose dog as . but i'll just draw different dog . my favourite animal is my own dog at home . that doesn't really look like him , actually . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and symbols . for remote control , do you think that will be suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . it does make sense from the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . so , possibly . and then and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . i'd say so , . , i've never bought remote control , so how how good remote control that would get you . but , suppose it has to look and gimmicky . let me just scoot on ahead here . does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue ? or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one . know my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . so for them it was just how many devices control . so , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses so . so do you think that should be like main design aim of our remote control , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . they're gone from being just like little scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda . so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , . or even like , , notes about what you wanna watch . like you might put in there want to watch such and such and look that's good idea . so extra functionalities . like , personally for me , at home i've i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them . you keep losing them . finding them is really pain , . it's usually quite small , or when you want it , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table . you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep . that's just really good id . there is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? actually had cable between it and the t_v_ and big like buttons that like , like on blender . and , , when about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still , , like massive junky thing on the table . still feels quite primitive . we could think about how , could be more , , streamlined . like touch screen ? something like that , . or whatever would be technologically reasonable . that's up to our industrial designer . 'cause it could it could it could be that it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having , these days there's pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , . or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ? just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , . one factor would be production cost . because there's cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price . that that's the maor .
imagine that's good question . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and symbols .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert . just down here ? what are we doing next ? we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . can we just go over that again ? so bas at twel alright , . like on the shelf . imagine that's good question . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . gosh , should be writing all this down . away i'm making some assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . so i'm wondering away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or . like how much does , , remote control cost . twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .
this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager . do you want to introduce yourself again ? so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , . so it's the functional design stage is next , . and and that's the end of the meeting .
we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . can we just go over that again ? so bas at twel alright , .
so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , . so it's the functional design stage is next , .
so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . clunky in what sense , like heavier ? it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size . see , so it's more just basic . got very few buttons on it and , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? up the numbers , or the up down ? wou would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , would anybody disagree with that ? what else , so don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , like brightness and contrast ? es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising . we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? is that what we're we're doing ? we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ?
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . who would like to go first ? i'll go first . alright , can st steal this from the back of your laptop ? so this is the technical functions design . go on ahead . to do the the design have i've had look online , i've had look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products . i've had look at the previous products to see what they offer and would like to ask you for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so , having look at the existing products , found out that it tends to come in two extremes , there's either very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you what you're doing . in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . there's an example i'll show you at the end , sh show you now . here the button there and there . this one's prog . that one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . not if you had look at the other control in that example . it's very simple one . it's got only the basic functions but it's the same size as the the hard to use one . it looked bit clunky . they're very big and not very much use for buttons . and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . there's there's nothing for slow motion button . my own preferences , prefer the the clunky one . it's very easy to use . but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which quite like having on the controls . so believe the the advanced functions should be hidden in drawer , like tha from the bottom of it . so , now i'd like to ask for your preferences . not of how long we've got , , the clunky one is the one on the . can chat away for for five minutes or so at at most . so in part could could give you some of my personal preferences but could also add some to this which is just about market research . but anyway , we might come to that later . shall we sh 'll stick to your area for now . which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . clunky in what sense , like heavier ? it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size . see , so it's more just basic . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that .

they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that .
so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is .

is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else .
like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea . it's good idea . so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ . and then actual numbers for channels as , . you say that's required one or requested one ? which was that ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere . and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? that's the thing , i'm i'm not because on the the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . or , just the idea , but i'm not . so that's something we can discuss as . so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the t_v_ , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company . so is everybody with any of that , or do you want me to recap ? nope , we're all set .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . so just to to recap on what we did last time . got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , , cost-wise how much how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere . and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? that's the thing , i'm i'm not because on the the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea . it's good idea . so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ . and then actual numbers for channels as , . you say that's required one or requested one ? which was that ? would you like the channels like the the numbers on thing , , . up the numbers , or the up down ? wou would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , would anybody disagree with that ? what else , so don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , like brightness and contrast ? es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising . we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? is that what we're we're doing ? we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip .
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ?
is that alright now ? everybody all set to start the meeting ? we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . could you plug me in ? all ready to go ? so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip . and others that are also available and then others that are concealed . something like that .

like in circular in shape or choice of material . 'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape . it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either . no no no not . it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . so should we go with that ?
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting . is there anything have forgotten anything ?
so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as . so that's what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ? as for the case , discussed that know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel . and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .

can it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but you ask away . question on can ask question ? can we power light in this ? can we get strong enough battery to power light ? we could because the panel requires power , and the is form of light so that are you thinking are you thinking of of light in the sense of light light , or light in the sense of it glows frankenstein , it's alive . so one of the things we can just try and include is really good battery . like phone , like the backlight in phone . like phone , . whereas with phones , people charge them once week . we're gonna need to put in really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days . that's why the option of the the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? you wanna draw onto the . so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . sh we've got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ? i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , . no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much . he made that . and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow . and then the the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the the colour , you said company colour yellow . if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . and colour-wise what does everybody think ? it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting . why don't get that ? screwed in quite tightly . what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gonna try incorporate it but we hadn't made definite decision on that ? should also point out that the the final objective of this meeting is to reach decision on the concepts of the product . so that's the end result hopefully . alright so is it function eight ? hopefully appear in wee second . up there we go . like phone , like the backlight in phone . like phone , . whereas with phones , people charge them once week . we're gonna need to put in really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days . that's why the option of the the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? so you could trigger that to light , like said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness . let's just go back to the marketing ideas for start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . what does everybody think about does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? that's the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? we could go for like not fruit shape but very curvy type shape . you could have the same texture and colour as fruit . so do are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ? probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much . he made that . and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow . and then the the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the the colour , you said company colour yellow . if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? does it need with square thing wha 'cause that will help narrow down the choice of like fruit . like in circular in shape or choice of material . 'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch . i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape . it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either . no no no not . it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . so should we go with that ? and colour-wise what does everybody think ? it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , . or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . that might scare me . any thoughts on that ? that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought . do we need an display ? what what's the functionality of that ? but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? what would it achieve ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of . l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about . and the the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is . that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday . so so no need for an display ? i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? that would make it very complex . we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there need for the remote control to to talk back ? if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back . you could put game on it . does anybody disagree with that ? when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control . so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , do you wanna group them into head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . what else do you need to talk about ? where would you physically position the buttons ? that that has some impact on on on many things . you wanna draw onto the . so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . sh we've got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ? i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , . no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just . so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as . so that's what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ? as for the case , discussed that know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel . and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're we're using to to achieve those goals ? like so so backlighting , that would be good . could have things like backlighting the buttons and like that . or even clear case . clear , that'd be . aye that would be good idea . in in slight subtle way . so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it . that'd be really good .
do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , . or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . that might scare me . any thoughts on that ? that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ?
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ?

's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan . so that was the last meeting . alright so let's have look here . so this was the method that i've taken . here we go . what wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is want to show you all the background information have that we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . and and then sorta go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information , and then bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . so i've tried to take whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are are in sync and are important to our our project plan that we have so far , and then initiate discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other other elements of the of the project . does that make sense , tha that strategy ? that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why suggested we get in this . aye fair point definitely . so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br television remote control , fancy look and feel , , and not , it specified , not functional look or or feel , fancy . however , this is where we kinda have to be very , , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . so that tells me that we have to find way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary functional bits to it . and third priority for ease of use , so again that gives us general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i'll just say away as bit of foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of marketing , is that what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up , what , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? that's where we're gonna go with this . then there's the other aspect of the back the the market research have here is on fashion style , , which as we've is priority . top european fashion trend that read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , , especially in clothes and furniture . and when first saw that , do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get into it , or we completely steer away from it , do what ? so my my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . 'cause what we're in what we're in is partly home decor , partly something like computer , so we might wanna be careful about how how quickly we create like remote control in the shape of an apple , that would be pushing it . and then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . so probably lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , that'll be in our favour . so these this is the summary of everything . style is number one thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . innovative design technology's also must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that's the way interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i've written at written at the bottom to give us context of discussion , mac ipods , something which is , i'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . what mac ipod is ? that's true , . i'm thinking however mac ipod is last year's because it's very hard and glassy and glossy , so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of mac ipod and we're then making it more of like more of like comfortable type of or more of like more vibrant to friendly thing to have . and then so this is with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . like like we think of some thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like marketing identity . does that make sense ? so so like threw out few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . like the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like theme to it would be like like lemon like that , something which is , like you see lot in in other areas . like see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it's just just an idea . i'm thinking we could incorporate some of these features into fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like like something to do with like lighting within it . like just within the simple sense , when you pick up phone and touch button it lights up , usually the buttons light up . how can we build on that ? like it could light up in different colours or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers so . anyway those are that's all have , but hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into . craig do you wanna plug yours in then ?
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . that's the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? we could go for like not fruit shape but very curvy type shape . you could have the same texture and colour as fruit . so do are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ? probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much .
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . and so think of this concept . to research it i've had look on the the homepage again . it's provided me with more examples of previously existing remote controls . there's wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so i've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this so then this we're looking for suggestions on size size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . what found from the research is that most the current controls are just big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're hold like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . the the controls themselves tend to use very inconsistent colour scheme .
i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? that would make it very complex . we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there need for the remote control to to talk back ? if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back . you could put game on it . does anybody disagree with that ?
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , . i'm not if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . there's problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control get with the the red colour button for stand-by and the other examples of that the buttons should be large . they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . they should be easy to press , very comfortable . one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have v_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be down volume button , that's kinda confusing . should avoid things like that . if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . do we have corporate colour scheme ? it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after . and the play-doh 's yellow . any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be hidden , they shouldn't be on the shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some special extra effort . if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , they got cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look . that's just wrong . and we got an email from it's the the research department , and they've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask it question . so it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take and possibility . aye that's good idea , . and these are problems i've had with it . where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . it's , fashion into electronics . and we how flexible the colour scheme is . you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say if we can use any other colours or that's it . lots of good information there .
any thoughts on that ? that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought . do we need an display ? what what's the functionality of that ? but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? what would it achieve ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of . l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about . and the the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is . that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday . so so no need for an display ? i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , . it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background . everything have is kinda background . we all ready to go ? the components are exactly the same . like what you said , the most input that's needed is in the user interface . the rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . like you said time to market was problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost . and the power is factor of that . and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how more how you hold rather than the actual use using the the remote control because like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . so it's just matter of working out space . so three things , cost , complexity , and the size . these are the three things that will have an impact on you . so just go through it in the components . these are the options that are available to you , i'm not very about the voice thing 'cause got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are . it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . it said something about sensor but never clarified that . so if you could see the other email that they sent you , 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa so your basic components are buttons , and you have wheel available , like mouse scroll wheel , there's an display , these are quite standard things . they're standard , aren't they ? no they're the sense that these are all the options available for you . i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again bit later . then there's how the case actually looks . it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , don't think you can use them in combination , but could check back for you , but don't think you can actually use them in combination . we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , wasn't i'm not very about the titanium . they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . the rubber was restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from cost perspective and complexity just to use one . as opposed to two . and the other components are logic chips , again i'll i'll go back to the component chips . the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit and that impacts cost . don't think the logic chip has issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . power consumption should be about the same . the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options . the first one is standard battery . the second one is more of gimmick then actually useable thing , it's wind-up , crank . i'll clear one of these things for you . just by moving it . but that that might be something that's more of look and feel decision because don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . whatever it is you still need battery 'cause don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . the other ones are solar powered cell , which may not be idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . so like what said , you probably need like battery and something else . and the kinetic one for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's sales gimmick . from marketing gimmick it it's technology thing , it's shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it . you have you had those balls , those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , that might be gimmick combined with rubber . just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , just so . my from my role , don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , something comfortable to hold , small and slim that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , like phone , too small phone . and the other thing is from production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so . let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard , the panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . the case with rubber case you can't have the solar panels . with the titanium case , let me just check that , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood . it can't be curved . so that's again , don't think you can use them in combination , especially the titanium suspect they're very fixed to particular need .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . so we're just estimating that it would be less . how about these ? are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ? so we're quite far over . now we're gonna something's gonna have to go . we're at sixteen point eight and something has to go to the tune of two point three euro , so let me see , what are we yes , four point three . how how are we going to achieve this high-end product if we only have very sparse two point three ?
just need to know so write it down . that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything . so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as ? we need an . and that's because of cost restraints is it ? what about the electronics here ? we need an advanced chip , . but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . no , , . dunno do you it means it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so . on dif answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then then we're told use the co company company colours .
we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons . no can do . we could just go with . normal coloured buttons . do you want colour differentiation here ? no that's not the button we're talking about .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as . anything i've missed ? so if you want to present your prototype go ahead . this is it ? ninja homer , made in japan . there are few changes we've made . look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and inside , so instead we've this is gonna be an screen , just very very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and confirm button . apart from that , it's just the same as we discussed last time . and there isn't it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? so the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use . where are they ? they're in the panel and the jog-dial ? 'cause the panel just displays functionally what you're doing . so what thing is gonna be . if you're using an advanced function , like brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say it's like it only has four columns , it's very simple like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . it might even be one , bit more complex panel with pictures like the sun or the , , the the symbols of the various functions . and what is this here ? that's number pad . so the number pad is , . where are we gonna have the slogan ? they're al along this . just like inside there . you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as , or at the bottom . 'cause slogans are usually quite small , , they're not like huge so they're say button's about say button's about this size , , so you would still have plenty of space for slogan , say even for that . plus half five six seven eight , about nine total . about nine in total . six , seven , eight , nine , ten . so we're talking about ten centimetres . that sounds good . that would be good . that's and it's very bright as . is it possible i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? 'm we're gonna have again the the the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . but this button , because it's red it's very prominent , we're gonna use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for two seconds it'll send stand-by signal . so just could you just list all the things that it does so write them in the report . apart from that it's gonna be used as confirm button for the screen and you use this as jog-dial . so that's like an button , . we've discussed how high it is , but how wide is it ? how high is it ? no as in the height , but what about the width ? don't think five is be about three and half . something by there . is this to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there . so you can power on and off , what else can you do ? three and half . you can skip straight to channel using these buttons . were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . jog-dial for volume . and what else do you do with the jog-dial ? you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and . contrast , brightness , , and anything else ? just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ? are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ? probably colour or sharpness . colour , sharpness . lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . what about sound settings ? can you change any of those ? audio , we have like your basic your base , your mid-range , your high range . the the balance . left-right balance , even pre-programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting . that's could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? was that an option ? it'll be cost prohibitive , . we've only got like what , ten cents left so . it would cost more than plastic . logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?
so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . course , that's true . so then you have bit more freedom to you you still have your blue fingers . let me get that . so what this is is set-up for us to use like the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as criteria of evaluation for the for the current design or the plan , and so we can review that . you killed monster . it's gonna end up being elementary because we're sort we're in we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? there it is . and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be way for us to go through and decide if we're review where we stand with it . so so to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , . so these these are the and we've been asked to to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just work on consensus system so we just come to an agreement . so the first one , stylish look and feel . rate that pretty highly . compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . me my only reservation with it was that we went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and if yellow's gonna really be hit . i'm seeing five then . would say five or six . i'm fine with that . let's go with five then . fi just actually the opposite . it's one to seven , ? one's high-ish isn't it ? one is high . so , two or three . let's go with two point five then . control high tech innovation . has the wee jog-dial but . we had to remove , so we've had to remove few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good . i'd go with three or four , three . say it's more medium , but going towards little bit higher than medium thing . about three , . style reflects fruit inspired colour , design . shouldn't have said colour , but just sorta . that's but the yellow , it could be lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ? the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the the the red button , they because for want of , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . so we'll go two . and design is simple to use , simple in features . it's really basic looking isn't it ? fairly basic , you think ? i'd give that nearly one . soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite bit of compromise for price . it's about five . that's really low . we have to use plastic so it's probably gonna be i'd probably increase the cost . it'll be cost prohibitive , . we've only got like what , ten cents left so . it would cost more than plastic . logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there ? and it's within budget , . it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ?
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
how much would that save us ? that will only save you one . that is one . the other thing could be that you could take away the panel and the advanced chip together , because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as , so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , which is technically doable thing so . that's fair enough , . so so what's our reviewed suggestion ?
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as . anything i've missed ? so what do we do . we're told terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like formality then an actual within the constraints the . you feel like you're caged within whatever it's like balloon in cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . the constraints do come in very fast . do what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , . so still on the topic of room for creativity next up is craig . agree with his point it's it is quite lot of fun to go and then you have hit the end then go , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also very strong factor , and structure . because for brainstorming meeting you want structure thows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . is there anything else it can do ? that 'cause that's that's fine . just need to know so write it down . that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything . so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as ? we need an . and that's because of cost restraints is it ? what about the electronics here ? so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear . like so push button and integrated scroll wheel push . so reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . i'm not if that counts but you can see we're we're all very far beyond the could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . and special colour for the buttons , so four again . so why are we arriving at the number four ? functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is good estimate for , so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . do you think ? like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is single panel . have point three to get rid of somewhere . we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons . no can do . we could just go with . normal coloured buttons .
just need to know so write it down . that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything . so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? do we have kinetic as ? we need an . and that's because of cost restraints is it ? what about the electronics here ? we need an advanced chip , . single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing . so we want double-curved ? is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ? we're gonna have to skip the rubber . so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ? for the case itself , one colour . we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for for the buttons . no can do . we could just go with . normal coloured buttons . do you want colour differentiation here ? no that's not the button we're talking about . so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . ach that's shame . so take away that completely ? and now we're under budget . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . doesn't say so . but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . no , , . dunno do you it means it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so . on dif answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then then we're told use the co company company colours .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . so just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as . anything i've missed ? so if you want to present your prototype go ahead . to record it and haven't been asked to submit it yet . just wondering if need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then . it keeps getting too big . next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i'm playing with the play-doh as . just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ? or our work on setting this up . is it i'll just go through your system then . the the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , , as in other words this this room is centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just debating , but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we put out our ideas and then , . do you feel though that that you were able to have quite lot of creative input into the thing ? but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . so what do we do . we're told terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like formality then an actual within the constraints the . you feel like you're caged within whatever it's like balloon in cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . the constraints do come in very fast . do what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , . so still on the topic of room for creativity next up is craig . agree with his point it's it is quite lot of fun to go and then you have hit the end then go , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also very strong factor , and structure . because for brainstorming meeting you want structure thows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . and that point about the room not being very friendly to that , that's very big thing , and the fact that we're wearing these things restricts feel it 'cause wear my glasses , , and that but that irritates me it it it does actually affect how , whether you feel comfortable to communicate .
it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ? out of forty nine , . out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 's pretty good . so it's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . 'cause if you turn that into hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's , about seventy , seventy percent .
we all all set ? this is the final detailed design meeting . we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
is this to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there . so you can power on and off , what else can you do ? three and half . you can skip straight to channel using these buttons . were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . jog-dial for volume . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . doesn't say so . how about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? that's good idea . does that mean that one button has special form or . there's just one button so handy .
let me just confirm that . the case , what does it mean by single and double , do ? single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing . so we want double-curved ? is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ? we're gonna have to skip the rubber .
making profit of fifty million euros . alright so twenty five . so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . so , i've the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . was thinking that as , the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the one for all type things where they're , . the universal ones . so presumably that might be an idea to put into .

minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television . so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .

'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . alright , so sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . that was more of gimmick . do you think ? it makes it fairly unnecessary then . so scratch that .

we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . so multi-coloured buttons . you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , . or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . makes it easy to use .
we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ?

we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i've just left my first two screens . have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls . the last one is the most important one , is it ? no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .
no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology .

no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . so that indicates our technological advancement . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or . and they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . i'm not about that . so , in order to save our two euros was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . more like traditional remote control . it's already got shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved in and out . and by doing so no , hold on . doesn't save us quite as much . what's going on with this again . does it go back in , does it ? something we should get . what this is but it's really really annoying . have , yes . mine needs also this . at last mine is also the presentation .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , .

we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or .

we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ?
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . he's gonna get his pen . will you first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato . , we had some red left over . so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . the yellow there is the the slogan , , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . so the buttons would be like , individual users , or . unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros . so we have to rea , i've accidentally highlighted somehow . what's on the on the left ? there we go . why is it doing that ? there we go . so , in order to save our two euros was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . more like traditional remote control .
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , . how was that , was that fun ? i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but will do . excuse me forgot my copy . alright , , . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you .

so , this is first meeting of this design project . and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you . didn't receive it yet . anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more . then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .

all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ? so it seems like feasible thing to implement for for limited . but if you wanna look into that just to just to check . so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then we're going to get anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . but , , , . don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls . now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .
all hooked up . so now we are here at the functional design meeting . hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder . if that meant that you could see it or not . i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . wi on on what ?

is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ? yes , so . i'll do that next time . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . and we've got forty minutes to do that in . so would say ? the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . quickly jotted them down . so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . so the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . how however , our our remote control would only be dealing with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . so he he here is functional overview of the remote control . there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i'll basic go over to the . what's the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and screens in remote control . not that they actually gave me any answers on the screens , so should have taken that bit out , but anyway . what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . eighty percent of users would spend more to get , looking remote control . so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , but , it's up there . the remote control . so the the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ . this is pink because was copying and pasting the table , and didn't have time to white it out again . don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls . now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . we need both . what wh what was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that want to go onto channel number forty five . that would be another way to do it . but but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it and and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on remote control though ?

'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . the , but it solves the problem of having different noises . we're gonna have to wrap this up .

then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . and we've got forty minutes to do that in . so would say ? the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . quickly jotted them down . so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . so the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . how however , our our remote control would only be dealing with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . so he he here is functional overview of the remote control . there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i'll basic go over to the . but then other functionalities could be just there could be menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu . and , the last question had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . so at the for the time being that's that's all . if you have questions , and also it's it's other question is because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . if that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had decent case for that we really t's important to include video and d_v_d_ , could get back to them and see . it's it's just whether it's worth arguing about . so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , but , it's up there . the remote control . so the the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ . this is pink because was copying and pasting the table , and didn't have time to white it out again . don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls . now the the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's it's safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . we need both . what wh what was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that want to go onto channel number forty five . that would be another way to do it . but but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it and and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on remote control though ? so that you can yell at it , . , so you have to have the remote control . it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , . but then the remote control the idea is it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep near yourself . no , but was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , and not to yell at it from the distance . so wh another thing that can be used is that there can be beeper button on the t_v_ , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . that's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but you could have something , but if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v_ , some like two if you bought it in two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v_ . 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . the , but it solves the problem of having different noises . we're gonna have to wrap this up .
so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . if you got chance to just have look at it . anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching . do you wanna start again ?

think we can first . it was function eight . this one there . i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it's gotta look like it's in the and . the the company it's it's , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . we put the fashion in electronics . we have to carry that mental . there you go .

's just an idea . done , catherine . let's plug you in , baby . the blue thing . , this is getting all . then you just have to do function eight and it should come up . it it just takes wee while . it just takes second .

used to eat it . i've , i've definitely eaten it before . didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? let's have your let's get have the presentation ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . so , everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here . so , , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , , the thumb button is the power button . your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . what's the big blue thing ? , these these ones on the side are curved , so the buttons are rubber . are they made out of any special material ? no they're not . they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple . they're rubber , aren't they ? so let's see if that comes within budget . i'd say it's about twoish ? it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , , , . so criteria three is is it easy to use ? it's one , . i'd say it's wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . would give it would give it two , 'cause it it it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but . two , so it's but if we make right-handed and left-handed then ? if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then would give it one , but otherwise otherwise two . give it give it two . criteria four is costs . it's come in under budget .
didn't know was edible . but , it's it's made edible 'cause , . it's it's chew proof . it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then , normal babies . actually that makes sense , because remember like , peopl if my mom ever did it but remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some dough . it is , . everybody everybody ready ? let's have your let's get have the presentation ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . what's the big blue thing ? that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button . and then it also has digit for muting the and then then you can also there's numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we t's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . that certainly does . so all the , the important keys are at your at at convenient place for you to to access them . but then but then you can learn to use your like was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? didn't didn't think about that , but i'd , . know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . i'm they'll be able to it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , , extraordinary . everybody can press button with their left and hand so , it's not . imagine are you handed ? this is where we all get to get to write on the , , on the board . love the smell of that play-doh . have some have some . so , evaluation . we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . i've got the criterias . this isn't simulation , this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just , , they get . they're actually trying to find ideas for ideal remote . they're using our ideas . two years' time this will be on the market . ex exactly that product thum we'll go , , we designed that and no-one will believe us . but no , when this meeting's finished like officially , there we'll get questionnaire to fill in .

good to see you all again . let's see if that comes up . this is our functional design meeting . just sec while my powerpoint comes up . we put the fashion in electronics . our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? e-mailed them to you . i'm also putting them in the shared folder . so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions . finally we'll just close . we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . so first of all the functional design objectives . we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . three presentations , you can go in any order you choose . shall we go in the order that you just did it ?

time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again .
time is it ? fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . that would be me . function eight it .

welcome to our detailed design meeting . i'm pretty excited . let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that . the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria . we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the last the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .

didn't get any pictures . it's single curved . it's single curved . t's not the . it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important . that is important .
